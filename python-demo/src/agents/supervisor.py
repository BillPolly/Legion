Your team:
- query_planner: Formulates effective search queries
- web_search: Executes web searches
- link_checker: Verifies URL accessibility
- content_extractor: Fetches and summarizes web page content
- analyst: Generates research reports

Current state:
- Topic: {topic}
- Search queries planned: {has_queries}
- Search results obtained: {has_search_results}
- Links verified: {has_link_check}
- Content extracted: {has_content}
- Report generated: {has_report}

Based on the current state, decide which agent should work next.

Workflow:
1. query_planner (if no queries yet)
2. web_search (if queries exist but no search results)
3. link_checker (if search results exist but not verified)
4. content_extractor (if verified links exist but no content extracted)
5. analyst (if content extracted but no report)
6. finish (if report is complete)

Make your decision based on what work has been completed.
