# Neo4j DataSource Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology without the refactor phase - we aim to get it right first time. The plan is organized in phases that build upon each other, with each phase delivering demonstrable value.

## Implementation Rules

1. **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, then implementation to make tests pass
2. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: All integration tests use real Neo4j instance
3. **No Mocks in Implementation**: Implementation code never contains mocks or stubs
4. **No Fallbacks**: Fail fast with clear errors - no silent failures or fallbacks
5. **Test Coverage**: Both unit and integration tests for all components
6. **Design Reference**: Always refer to design.md for specifications
7. **Dependency Order**: Build core mechanisms first, then elaborate
8. **MVP Focus**: Functional correctness only - no NFRs, security, or performance optimization

## Notes

- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Integration tests use real Neo4j instance (no mocks)
- Implementation code contains no mocks or fallbacks
- All errors are thrown immediately (fail fast)
- Design document is the source of truth for all specifications
- Update this document with âœ… as steps are completed
