# Filesystem DataSource Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology without the refactor phase - we aim to get it right first time. Implementation proceeds in phases with natural dependency ordering, ensuring each phase delivers demonstrable value.

## Core Rules

1. **NO MOCKS** - Integration tests use real filesystem operations
2. **NO MOCKS IN IMPLEMENTATION** - Implementation code never contains mock implementations
3. **NO FALLBACKS** - Errors are raised immediately, no silent failures
4. **FAIL FAST** - Any error condition stops execution immediately
5. **REFERENCE DESIGN** - Every phase begins by re-reading the design document
6. **TEST FIRST** - Write tests before implementation for each component
7. **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING** - Both unit and integration tests for all functionality
