# Hierarchical Components Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the refactor step - we aim to get implementation correct on the first attempt. The plan implements the hierarchical component system as defined in `HIERARCHICAL_COMPONENTS_DESIGN.md`.

## Implementation Rules

### Testing Principles
- **NO MOCKS in integration tests** - All integration tests use real components, real DOM, and real data stores
- **NO MOCKS in implementation code** - Implementation must not contain any mock or fallback implementations
- **NO FALLBACKS** - All errors must be raised immediately, no graceful degradation in implementation
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - Both unit and integration tests for all functionality
- **TDD without refactor** - Write tests first, implement to pass, move to next feature

### Quality Standards
- **Functional correctness only** - Focus on MVP functionality, ignore NFRs like performance, security
- **Local running and UAT** - No publishing, deployment, or migration concerns
- **100% test pass rate** - All tests must pass before moving to next phase
- **Real component integration** - Integration tests use actual DOM rendering and state management

### Development Approach
- Each phase must be completed fully before moving to next phase
- All tests for a phase must pass before proceeding
- Implementation follows design document specifications exactly
- No deviation from architectural principles defined in design
