# Project Management Agent - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements the Project Management Agent using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Each phase delivers working, tested functionality that provides immediate value. The implementation follows a natural dependency order, building from core graph operations to complete MCP server integration.

## Approach

### TDD Without Refactor
- Write failing test first
- Implement minimal code to pass test
- Get it right first time - no refactor phase needed
- All tests must pass before proceeding

### 80/20 Rule
- Focus on core functionality that delivers 80% of value
- Defer edge cases and optimizations
- Each phase must produce demonstrable working software

### Testing Rules

**CRITICAL - NO MOCKS:**
- Unit tests: Mocks ONLY where absolutely necessary (e.g., external APIs if unavoidable)
- Integration tests: NO MOCKS for main functionality - real Neo4j database
- Integration tests: Mocks allowed ONLY for peripheral concerns (e.g., MCP transport layer)
- Implementation code: NO MOCKS EVER - no fallbacks, no mock implementations
- E2E tests: NO MOCKS - real MCP server, real Neo4j, real agent interactions

**FAIL FAST:**
- NO fallbacks in implementation or tests
- If resource unavailable → test FAILS (don't skip)
- If connection fails → FAIL (don't retry with mock)
- All required resources available in .env (Neo4j, API keys, etc.)

**Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for all Neo4j operations
- E2E tests for complete MCP tool workflows

### Resources Available
- Real Neo4j database (local or configured in .env)
- Real MongoDB (local, already configured)
- Real Qdrant (local, already configured)
- Real API keys in .env
- NO SKIPPING - everything needed is available
