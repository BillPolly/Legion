# Data-Store Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach without the refactor step - we aim to get the implementation right on the first attempt based on the comprehensive design document. The implementation will be built in phases with each step thoroughly tested before moving to the next.

## Approach and Rules

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation using mocks where appropriate
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions with **NO MOCKS** - use real DataScript instances
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows from API to database
- All tests must pass before proceeding to the next step

### Implementation Rules
- **No Mocks in Implementation**: Production code must not contain any mock objects or fallback mechanisms
- **No Fallbacks**: All errors must be raised explicitly - no silent failures or default behaviors
- **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Integration tests must use real DataScript instances and actual component interactions
- **Functional Correctness Only**: Focus on MVP functionality - no performance optimization, security, or migration concerns
- **Local Testing Only**: No deployment, publishing, or production concerns

### Development Workflow
1. **Write Test First**: Define expected behavior through tests
2. **Implement to Pass**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure all edge cases are covered
4. **Move to Next Step**: Only proceed when all tests pass
