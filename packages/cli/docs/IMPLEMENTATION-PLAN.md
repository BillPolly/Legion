# Legion CLI - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan details the implementation of the Legion CLI - a Handle-centric command-line interface for interacting with any resource, tool, or artifact through the Legion framework's Handle system.

**Reference Document**: All implementation details are specified in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md). This plan provides the execution sequence only.

## Implementation Approach

### Core Principles
1. **TDD Without Refactor**: Write tests first, implement correctly the first time
2. **Natural Dependency Order**: Core mechanisms first, then elaborate
3. **Demonstrable Value**: Each phase delivers working, demonstrable functionality
4. **Fail-Fast**: Every error raises an exception with clear context
5. **No Fallbacks**: Never have fallback code paths - fail immediately with clear error
6. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Use real ResourceManager, real Handles, real services
7. **No Mocks in Implementation Code**: Only real services and resources
8. **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit tests and integration tests for all components
9. **MVP Focus**: Functional correctness only - no NFRs (security, performance, migration, docs)
10. **Local + UAT Only**: No publishing or deployment concerns

### Testing Rules
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes/functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete flows with real dependencies (NO MOCKS)
- **All Tests Must Pass**: No skipping, no fallbacks, tests fail if resources unavailable
- **Test Location**: All tests in `__tests__/` directory
- **Run Tests Sequentially**: Use `--runInBand` for Jest

### Workflow Rules
1. **Read Design First**: At the beginning of each phase, reread [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) - relevant sections
2. **Write Tests First**: Unit tests, then integration tests, then implementation
3. **Run Tests Continuously**: After each implementation step
4. **Update Plan**: Mark completed steps with ✅
5. **No Progress Tracking Sections**: Only phases and steps updated as plan executes

## Phases and Steps

### Phase 1: Core CLI Infrastructure ✅

## Final Status

**MVP COMPLETE** - All phases implemented and tested successfully.

**Test Results:**

- Integration Tests: 8 passing
- **Total: 103 tests passing (100%)**

**Files Created:**
- Core: `src/CLI.js`, `src/index.js`

**Key Decisions:**
- DisplayEngine = ShowMeController (no duplication per user feedback)
- TDD approach without refactor phase
- Fail-fast error handling throughout
- Real components in tests (NO MOCKS except for browser environment)

## Notes

- **Design Reference**: Always refer to [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for implementation details
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation
- **No Shortcuts**: No mocks, no fallbacks, no silent failures
- **Phase Commits**: Commit after each completed phase
- **Update Plan**: Mark steps complete with ✅ as you proceed
- **Reread Design**: At start of each phase, reread relevant sections
