# KG-DataScript Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan details the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for implementing the unified KG-DataScript system as specified in the design document. The implementation will proceed in phases, with each phase building on the previous one. All functionality will be comprehensively tested with both unit and integration tests. remeber to update THIS document ONLY with process. rember to run the tests and do not proceed untill you get %100 pass.

## Approach and Rules

### TDD Methodology
- Write tests first, then implementation
- Red → Green cycle (no refactor step - get it right first time)
- Every feature must have comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests validate real system behavior

### Critical Implementation Rules
- **NO MOCKS in integration tests** - Use real DataScript, real objects, real store
- **NO MOCKS in implementation code** - No fake implementations or stubs
- **NO FALLBACKS** - Raise errors immediately on failure
- **FAIL FAST** - Any error condition should throw immediately
- **Objects First** - Live systems work with actual objects, not IDs
- **Store Operations** - All updates go through the live store

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each component in isolation
- Integration tests for system interactions
- All tests must pass before moving to next step
- Tests use real ResourceManager and dependencies
- No test skipping or conditional execution

### MVP Scope
- Functional correctness only
- No NFRs (performance, security, scalability)
- No migration tooling
- No deployment configuration
- Local running and UAT only

### Step 7.3: Error Handling Validation
☐ Unit test: All error conditions throw appropriately
☐ Integration test: System fails fast on errors
☐ Integration test: No fallback behavior

## Completion Criteria

All boxes must be checked (☑) before the implementation is considered complete. Each checked box indicates:
- Tests written and passing
- Implementation complete
- No mocks used in integration tests
- No fallbacks in implementation
- Errors raised appropriately

## Next Steps After Completion

Once all phases are complete and all boxes checked:
1. Run complete test suite
2. Verify 100% test passage
3. Begin UAT with example applications
4. Gather feedback for future iterations (post-MVP)
