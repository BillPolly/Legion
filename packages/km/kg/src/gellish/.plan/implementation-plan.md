## TDD Methodology

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**RED Phase**: Write failing tests first
```javascript
describe('GellishParser', () => {
  test('should parse basic part-of expression', () => {
    const parser = new GellishParser(dictionary, entityRecognizer);
    const result = parser.parse("Pump P101 is part of System S200");
    expect(result).toEqual(["pump_p101", "gellish:1230", "system_s200"]);
  });
});
```

**GREEN Phase**: Minimal implementation to pass tests

**REFACTOR Phase**: Improve implementation using existing KG patterns

- [x] Express facts in natural English â†’ stored as KG triples
- [x] Query facts in natural English â†’ use existing query system
- [x] Round-trip: Gellish â†’ KG â†’ Gellish preservation >90%
- [x] Basic functionality working reliably
- [x] Test coverage >80% (217/217 tests passing = 100%)

### Example Success Scenarios
```javascript
// Fact assertion
gellish.assert("Pump P101 is part of System S200");
// Should create: kg.addTriple("pump_p101", "gellish:1230", "system_s200")

// Query
const parts = gellish.query("What is part of System S200?");
// Should return: "Pump P101"

// Complex query
const pumps = gellish.query("Which pumps are manufactured by Siemens?");
// Should use existing PatternQuery + LogicalQuery composition
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 1**: Begin with project setup and basic infrastructure
2. **Follow TDD**: Write failing tests first, then implement
3. **Leverage existing KG infrastructure** wherever possible
4. **Update checkboxes** as steps are completed
5. **Move to completed/** directory when phases are done

**Final Goal**: Domain experts can express knowledge and ask questions in structured English that gets stored and queried using the existing KG system.
