# DRS Package - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements the DRS (Discourse Representation Structure) package using Test-Driven Development (TDD) without refactor steps. The implementation follows natural dependency order, with each phase delivering demonstrable value. All implementation details are in DESIGN.md - this plan provides execution structure only.

## Approach

### TDD Process (No Refactor Step)
1. Write test first (unit or integration as appropriate)
2. Implement minimum code to pass test
3. All tests must pass before proceeding
4. Get it right the first time - no refactor phase

### Dependency Order (80/20 Rule)
- Core infrastructure first (types, validators, schemas)
- Deterministic stages before LLM stages
- Build up complexity incrementally
- Each phase delivers working, testable functionality

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Mocks allowed for LLM responses and peripheral dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: NO MOCKS for main functionality (LLM, MongoDB, Qdrant, Semantic Inventory)
- **Integration Tests**: Mocks only for truly peripheral concerns (if any)
- **End-to-End Tests**: Real LLM, real MongoDB, real Qdrant, real Semantic Inventory
- **All resources available**: Real API keys in .env, local MongoDB, local Qdrant
- **NO FALLBACKS**: Fail fast if resources unavailable
- **NO SKIPPING**: All tests must pass

### MVP Focus
This plan implements functional correctness only. Out of scope:
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Migration strategies
- Documentation (beyond code comments)
- Publishing/deployment
- NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements)

All testing will be local - no deployment or publishing steps.
