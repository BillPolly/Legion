You are a semantic equivalence evaluator. Your task is to determine whether two texts convey the same meaning.

Output ONLY JSON that matches the provided schema.

Task: Compare the original text with a paraphrase generated from its semantic representation (DRS). Determine if they are semantically equivalent.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Focus on MEANING, not exact wording
2. Equivalent means the core propositional content is the same
3. Minor differences in word choice don't matter if meaning is preserved
4. Differences in quantifier scope, negation, or participants DO matter
5. Provide honest assessment - it's OK if they're not equivalent

Original Text:
<<<{{originalText}}>>>

Paraphrase (from DRS):
<<<{{paraphrase}}>>>

Instructions:
1. Identify the core propositions in the original text:
   - Who/what entities are mentioned?
   - What events/actions occur?
   - What relationships exist?
   - What quantifiers/modifiers apply? (every, some, not, if, etc.)

2. Identify the core propositions in the paraphrase:
   - Same analysis as above

3. Compare the propositions:
   - Are the same entities referenced?
   - Are the same events described?
   - Are the same relationships expressed?
   - Are quantifiers and scope preserved?
   - Is negation preserved?
   - Are conditionals preserved?

4. Make your judgment:
   - equivalent: true if core meaning is the same, false otherwise
   - confidence: 0.0-1.0 score (0.0 = very uncertain, 1.0 = completely certain)
   - explanation: Brief reasoning for your judgment (1-2 sentences)

Examples:

Example 1 - Equivalent (simple sentence):
Original: "Alice reads."
Paraphrase: "A person reads."
Output: {
  "equivalent": true,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "explanation": "Both describe a reading event with a person as agent. The paraphrase uses a generic term 'person' instead of the name 'Alice', but the core proposition is preserved."
}

Example 2 - Equivalent (quantifier):
Original: "Every student read a book."
Paraphrase: "Every student read a book."
Output: {
  "equivalent": true,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "explanation": "Perfect match. Universal quantifier 'every' and existential 'a' are both preserved, maintaining the same quantifier scope."
}

Example 3 - Not Equivalent (missing negation):
Original: "Bob does not run."
Paraphrase: "Bob runs."
Output: {
  "equivalent": false,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "explanation": "The negation is missing in the paraphrase. Original states Bob does NOT run, but paraphrase states Bob DOES run - opposite meanings."
}

Example 4 - Equivalent (conditional preserved):
Original: "If Bob runs, Alice reads."
Paraphrase: "If a person runs then a person reads."
Output: {
  "equivalent": true,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "explanation": "The conditional structure (if-then) is preserved. Names are genericized to 'person', but the core conditional relationship between running and reading is maintained."
}

Example 5 - Not Equivalent (wrong participant):
Original: "Alice gave Bob a book."
Paraphrase: "Bob gave Alice a book."
Output: {
  "equivalent": false,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "explanation": "The roles are reversed. In the original, Alice is the giver and Bob is the recipient. In the paraphrase, Bob is the giver and Alice is the recipient."
}

Now evaluate the texts above.
