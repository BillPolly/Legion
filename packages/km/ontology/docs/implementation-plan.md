# Ontology Creation Service - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach to build the Ontology Creation Service incrementally, without the refactor step. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating demonstrable value at each checkpoint.

### Core Principles

1. **TDD Without Refactor** - Write tests first, implement to pass tests, get it right first time
2. **Bottom-Up Dependency Order** - Build foundational services before dependent services
3. **Fail Fast** - NO fallbacks, raise errors immediately when requirements not met
4. **Real Integration** - NO mocks in integration tests, use real LLM, real triplestore, real semantic search
5. **No Implementation Mocks** - NEVER add mock implementations or fallback code paths
6. **MVP Focus** - Functional correctness only, no NFRs (security, performance, migration)
7. **Local Running** - No publishing, deployment, or production concerns

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Test each service method in isolation
- Mock only external dependencies (triplestore, LLM, semantic search interfaces)
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)
- 100% pass rate required

**Integration Tests:**
- **NO MOCKS** - use real LLM client, real triplestore, real semantic search
- Test service combinations working together
- Test with real RDF data and actual LLM responses
- Slower execution (may take 10-30 seconds per test)
- 100% pass rate required

### Phases Overview

Each phase delivers a working, testable component:

- **Phase 0**: Infrastructure verification - confirm all dependencies work
- **Phase 1**: Hierarchy navigation - traverse rdfs:subClassOf chains
- **Phase 2**: Subsumption checking - detect inherited properties/relationships
- **Phase 3**: Ontology querying - find types with semantic search + hierarchy
- **Phase 4**: Gap analysis - identify missing types from text
- **Phase 5**: Specialization decisions - LLM decides reuse vs specialize
- **Phase 6**: Ontology extension - add new types to triplestore
- **Phase 7**: Sentence annotation - attach type metadata to text
- **Phase 8**: Main orchestrator - coordinate full pipeline
- **Phase 9**: End-to-end integration - process complete documents
- **Phase 10**: Dynamic supertype creation - automatically create abstractions

## Phase 10: Dynamic Supertype Creation

**Objective:** Automatically create intermediate parent classes and relationships when siblings are detected

**Demonstrable Value:** LLM intelligently creates abstractions (e.g., "Pump" parent for "CentrifugalPump", "ReciprocatingPump")

### Steps

- [✅] **Step 10.1**: Create `src/prompts/determine-parent-with-abstraction.hbs`
  - Prompt allows LLM to either USE_EXISTING parent or CREATE_PARENT with intermediate abstraction
  - Includes examples showing when to create abstractions (siblings with common patterns)
  - Returns action, parent info, grandparent, reasoning

- [✅] **Step 10.2**: Update `OntologyExtensionService.determineParentClass()`
  - Load new template with abstraction capability
  - Gather detailed info about existing classes (labels, descriptions, parents)
  - Handle CREATE_PARENT action by recursively creating parent first
  - Track created parents with Set to avoid duplicates in same batch
  - Check triplestore before creating to avoid duplicates across batches

- [✅] **Step 10.3**: Update `extendFromGaps()` to pass createdParents Set
  - Create Set at beginning of method
  - Pass to each determineParentClass call
  - Enables batch processing without duplicates

- [✅] **Step 10.4**: Bootstrap `kg:relatesTo` top-level relationship
  - Add `bootstrapTopLevelRelationship()` method
  - Create kg:relatesTo with domain=owl:Thing, range=owl:Thing
  - Check if already exists before creating
  - All ObjectProperties should inherit from kg:relatesTo

- [✅] **Step 10.5**: Update relationship creation to inherit from kg:relatesTo
  - Modify extendFromGaps() to call bootstrap before adding relationships
  - Add rdfs:subPropertyOf kg:relatesTo to all new relationships
  - Universal relationship hierarchy established

- [✅] **Step 10.6**: Write integration tests for dynamic entity abstraction (7 tests)
  - bootstrapTopLevelRelationship creates kg:relatesTo
  - determineParentClass with CREATE_PARENT creates intermediate parent
  - Pump abstraction created when adding second pump type
  - Third pump type uses existing Pump parent
  - Relationships inherit from kg:relatesTo
  - No duplicate parents created

- [✅] **Step 10.7**: Write E2E tests with real-world scenarios (5 tests)
  - Multiple pump types trigger Pump abstraction
  - Equipment hierarchy with industrial domain
  - All relationships inherit from kg:relatesTo
  - Complex industrial plant with multiple abstraction levels
  - Semantic search finds similar types

- [✅] **Step 10.8**: Run all Phase 10 tests - 100% pass required (12/12 tests passing - 7 integration + 5 E2E)

**Exit Criteria:** ✅ Dynamic abstractions created automatically - ALL TESTS PASSING (215/215 total: 203 previous + 12 Phase 10)

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ LLM creates "Pump" parent when it sees "CentrifugalPump" + "ReciprocatingPump"
- ✅ kg:relatesTo provides universal relationship base (domain: owl:Thing, range: owl:Thing)
- ✅ All relationships inherit from kg:relatesTo via rdfs:subPropertyOf
- ✅ No duplicate parents created across batches
- ✅ Recursive parent creation (can create parent of parent if needed)

**Test Results:**
```
CentrifugalPump → owl:Thing
Pump → owl:Thing (created dynamically by LLM)
ReciprocatingPump → kg:Pump
RotaryPump → kg:Pump
```
