# Plumbing Domain: Comprehensive Ontology Building Demonstration

## Executive Summary

This demonstration showcases the Legion Knowledge Management ontology builder processing **6 carefully curated sentences** across **2 thematic rounds** to build a rich plumbing domain ontology from scratch. The demonstration highlights:

- **Progressive Domain Building**: Round 1 establishes plumbing materials and infrastructure; Round 2 adds tasks, tools, and work activities
- **Dynamic Abstraction Creation**: The system autonomously creates intermediate parent classes (Pipe, MetalPipe, PlumbingTool, PlumbingFixture, Room, etc.) when it detects sibling patterns
- **Semantic Search Integration**: Finding and reusing existing types across rounds
- **Universal Relationship Hierarchy**: All object properties inherit from `kg:relatesTo`
- **Real-World Domain Coverage**: Materials, tools, tasks, locations, fixtures, and connections

**Final Ontology Statistics:**
- **20 Classes** organized in hierarchical structures
- **10 Datatype Properties** (attributes like material, isLeaking, torqueLevel)
- **11 Object Properties** (relationships like installs, repairs, tightens)
- **Multiple Abstraction Layers**: 7+ intermediate parent classes created dynamically

## Demo Overview

This demonstration processes **6 sentences** organized into **2 thematic rounds**:

### Round 1: Plumbing Materials & Infrastructure
Focus on pipes, materials, and basic installation

1. **"The plumber installs a copper pipe in the residential wall."**
   → Bootstrap: Create initial Plumber, Pipe, and location concepts

2. **"The PEX pipe connects to the gas water heater."**
   → Trigger dynamic abstraction: Existing Pipe + new PEXPipe

3. **"The galvanized steel pipe shows signs of corrosion."**
   → Use existing Pipe parent: Create SteelPipe → MetalPipe → Pipe hierarchy

### Round 2: Plumbing Tasks & Tools
Add tasks, tools, and work activities

4. **"The plumber repairs the leaking bathroom faucet."**
   → Expand domain: Add RepairTask, Faucet, Bathroom concepts

5. **"The apprentice plumber clears the clogged kitchen drain with a drain snake."**
   → Create Tool category: DrainSnake, and ApprenticePlumber specialization

6. **"The pipe wrench tightens the threaded pipe connection joint."**
   → Trigger Tool abstraction: DrainSnake + PipeWrench → PlumbingTool parent

---

## Initial State

**Before Processing:**
```
Classes: 0 (empty ontology)
Properties: 0
Relationships: 0
```

The system starts from a completely empty ontology. There are no pre-defined classes, properties, or relationships. Everything will be built incrementally from the input sentences.

---

## Round 1: Materials & Infrastructure

> **Theme**: Establish the foundation of plumbing materials, focusing on different pipe types and basic installation scenarios.

---

### Sentence 1: Bootstrap

#### Input
```
"The plumber installs a copper pipe in the residential wall."
```

#### Purpose
Bootstrap the ontology from empty state, creating the initial classes and relationships needed for the plumbing domain.

#### Processing

**Step 1: Entity Mention Extraction**

The LLM extracts entity type mentions:
```json
{
  "mentions": ["plumber", "pipe", "copper pipe", "wall", "residential wall"]
}
```

**Step 2: Semantic Search**

The system searches for existing types similar to these mentions:
- Result: **0 existing types found** (ontology is empty)
- **5 gaps identified** (all mentions are new)

**Step 3: Type-Level Analysis**

The LLM analyzes the sentence to extract TYPE-LEVEL information (not instance-level):

```json
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "Plumber",
      "description": "Professional who installs and maintains plumbing systems"
    },
    {
      "name": "Pipe",
      "description": "Hollow cylinder for conveying fluids"
    },
    {
      "name": "Wall",
      "description": "Vertical structure that encloses or divides a space"
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "material",
      "domain": "Pipe",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    },
    {
      "name": "buildingType",
      "domain": "Wall",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why These Classes?**
- **Plumber**: The agent performing the action (professional specialization)
- **Pipe**: The core artifact being installed (not "CopperPipe" - the LLM generalizes to the type)
- **Wall**: The location where installation occurs

**Why These Properties?**
- **material**: Captures that pipes can be made of different materials (copper, PEX, steel, etc.)
- **buildingType**: Captures that walls belong to different building types (residential, commercial, etc.)

**Step 4: Gap Analysis**

```
→ Gaps: 3 classes, 2 properties
→ Can reuse: 0 from hierarchy (empty ontology)
```

**Step 5: Universal Relationship Bootstrapping**

Since no relationships exist, the system bootstraps the universal top-level relationship:

```turtle
kg:relatesTo rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
kg:relatesTo rdfs:domain owl:Thing .
kg:relatesTo rdfs:range owl:Thing .
```

This creates a universal relationship that can connect ANY two classes. All specific relationships will inherit from this.

**Step 6: Ontology Extension**

The system extends the ontology:

**Classes Added:**
```turtle
kg:Plumber rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing ;
    rdfs:label "Plumber" ;
    rdfs:comment "Professional who installs and maintains plumbing systems" .

kg:Pipe rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing ;
    rdfs:label "Pipe" ;
    rdfs:comment "Hollow cylinder for conveying fluids" .

kg:Wall rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing ;
    rdfs:label "Wall" ;
    rdfs:comment "Vertical structure that encloses or divides a space" .
```

**Properties Added:**
```turtle
kg:material rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain kg:Pipe ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .

kg:buildingType rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain kg:Wall ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .
```

**Relationships Added:**
```turtle
kg:installs rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:subPropertyOf kg:relatesTo ;
    rdfs:domain kg:Plumber ;
    rdfs:range kg:Pipe .

kg:installedIn rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:subPropertyOf kg:relatesTo ;
    rdfs:domain kg:Pipe ;
    rdfs:range kg:Wall .
```

#### Result

**Ontology State After Sentence 1:**

```
Classes (3):
  owl:Thing
    └─ Plumber ⭐
    └─ Pipe ⭐
    └─ Wall

Object Properties (3):
  kg:relatesTo (owl:Thing → owl:Thing)
    ├─ installs (Plumber → Pipe)
    ├─ installedIn (Pipe → Wall)

Datatype Properties (2):
  material (Pipe → xsd:string)
  buildingType (Wall → xsd:string)
```

**Statistics:**
- Classes: 0 → 3 (+3)
- Properties: 0 → 2 (+2)
- Relationships: 0 → 3 (+3, including kg:relatesTo)

**Why This Matters:**

This sentence establishes the **foundational vocabulary** for the plumbing domain:
1. **Agent class** (Plumber) - who does plumbing work
2. **Artifact class** (Pipe) - the core plumbing component
3. **Location class** (Wall) - where work happens
4. **Action relationships** (installs, installedIn) - how entities relate
5. **Universal relationship** (kg:relatesTo) - the base for all future relationships

---

### Sentence 2: Dynamic Abstraction Trigger

#### Input
```
"The PEX pipe connects to the gas water heater."
```

#### Purpose
Trigger the system to recognize a pattern (multiple pipe types) and potentially create an intermediate abstraction. Also introduce appliance concepts.

#### Processing

**Step 1: Entity Mention Extraction**

```json
{
  "mentions": ["pipe", "water heater", "gas water heater", "PEX pipe"]
}
```

**Step 2: Semantic Search**

The system searches for existing types:
- **Found**: "pipe" matches existing `kg:Pipe` (high similarity)
- **Gaps**: "PEX pipe", "water heater", "gas water heater" are new

```
→ Found 1 existing types, 2 gaps
```

**Step 3: Type-Level Analysis**

```json
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "PEXPipe",
      "description": "Cross-linked polyethylene pipe used in plumbing"
    },
    {
      "name": "GasWaterHeater",
      "description": "Appliance that heats water using gas fuel"
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "flexibility",
      "domain": "PEXPipe",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Dynamic Parent Determination - PEXPipe**

The system now faces a key decision: what should be the parent of PEXPipe?

**LLM Decision Process:**

The system sends this prompt to the LLM:
```
New class: PEXPipe - Cross-linked polyethylene pipe used in plumbing
Domain: plumbing

Existing classes in ontology:
- Plumber (professional who installs plumbing systems)
- Pipe (hollow cylinder for conveying fluids)
- Wall (vertical structure)

You have TWO options:
A. USE_EXISTING - Choose an existing class as parent
B. CREATE_PARENT - Create a new intermediate parent class
```

**LLM Response:**
```json
{
  "action": "USE_EXISTING",
  "parent": "kg:Pipe",
  "reasoning": "PEXPipe is a specific type of Pipe. The existing Pipe class is appropriate as the parent."
}
```

**Why USE_EXISTING?**
- There's already a general `Pipe` class
- PEXPipe is clearly a specialization of Pipe
- No need for intermediate abstraction yet (only 2 pipe types so far)

**Step 5: Dynamic Parent Determination - GasWaterHeater**

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_PARENT",
  "parentName": "WaterHeater",
  "parentDescription": "Appliance for heating water",
  "grandparent": "owl:Thing",
  "reasoning": "GasWaterHeater is a specific type. Creating WaterHeater parent allows for future ElectricWaterHeater, SolarWaterHeater, etc."
}
```

**Why CREATE_PARENT?**
- The LLM anticipates there will be multiple types of water heaters
- Creating an intermediate `WaterHeater` parent enables future extensibility
- This shows forward-thinking abstraction

**Step 6: Parent Creation**

The system creates the new parent:

```turtle
kg:WaterHeater rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing ;
    rdfs:label "WaterHeater" ;
    rdfs:comment "Appliance for heating water" .
```

Then adds the child:

```turtle
kg:GasWaterHeater rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf kg:WaterHeater ;
    rdfs:label "GasWaterHeater" ;
    rdfs:comment "Appliance that heats water using gas fuel" .
```

#### Result

**Ontology State After Sentence 2:**

```
Classes (6):
  owl:Thing
    └─ Plumber ⭐
    └─ Pipe ⭐
        └─ PEXPipe ⭐ [NEW]
    └─ Wall
    └─ WaterHeater [NEW - ABSTRACTION]
        └─ GasWaterHeater [NEW]

Object Properties (4):
  kg:relatesTo (owl:Thing → owl:Thing)
    ├─ installs (Plumber → Pipe)
    ├─ installedIn (Pipe → Wall)
    ├─ connectsTo (PEXPipe → GasWaterHeater) [NEW]

Datatype Properties (2):
  material (Pipe → xsd:string)
  buildingType (Wall → xsd:string)
```

**Statistics:**
- Classes: 3 → 6 (+3: PEXPipe, WaterHeater, GasWaterHeater)
- Properties: 2 → 2 (no change)
- Relationships: 3 → 4 (+1: connectsTo)

**Key Observations:**

1. **Inheritance Hierarchy Forming**: `Pipe` now has a child `PEXPipe`
2. **Proactive Abstraction**: `WaterHeater` created even though only one type exists (anticipating future types)
3. **Semantic Search Working**: The system found and reused existing `Pipe` class
4. **Relationship Specialization**: `connectsTo` inherits from `kg:relatesTo`

---

### Sentence 3: Using Existing Parents

#### Input
```
"The galvanized steel pipe shows signs of corrosion."
```

#### Purpose
Demonstrate that the system can use existing parent classes and create multi-level hierarchies.

#### Processing

**Step 1: Entity Mention Extraction**

```json
{
  "mentions": ["pipe", "steel pipe", "galvanized steel pipe"]
}
```

**Step 2: Semantic Search**

```
→ Found 1 existing types (Pipe), 1 gaps (steel pipe)
```

**Step 3: Type-Level Analysis**

```json
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "SteelPipe",
      "description": "Pipe made of steel material"
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "isGalvanized",
      "domain": "SteelPipe",
      "range": "xsd:boolean"
    },
    {
      "name": "corrosionLevel",
      "domain": "SteelPipe",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Dynamic Parent Determination - SteelPipe**

The system now has an interesting situation:
- Existing classes: Plumber, Pipe, PEXPipe, Wall, WaterHeater, GasWaterHeater
- New class: SteelPipe

**LLM Decision Process:**

The LLM recognizes:
1. SteelPipe is a type of pipe
2. There's already a Pipe parent
3. But SteelPipe and PEXPipe are fundamentally different (metal vs. plastic)
4. It might be useful to create a MetalPipe intermediate parent

**LLM Response (after several attempts):**
```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_PARENT",
  "parentName": "MetalPipe",
  "parentDescription": "Pipe made from metal materials like steel or copper",
  "grandparent": "kg:Pipe",
  "reasoning": "SteelPipe is metal-based. Creating MetalPipe parent groups metal pipes (steel, copper, etc.) separately from plastic pipes (PEX)."
}
```

**Note**: The output shows the LLM tried this decision multiple times (lines 237-310 in the output), showing the system's determination to create the right abstraction.

**Why This Matters:**

This creates a **three-level hierarchy**:
```
Pipe (abstract)
├─ MetalPipe (metal-based pipes)
│   └─ SteelPipe (steel specifically)
└─ PEXPipe (plastic-based pipe)
```

This is semantically correct:
- Metal pipes vs. plastic pipes are fundamentally different
- SteelPipe and CopperPipe (from sentence 1's material property) would be siblings under MetalPipe
- PEXPipe remains under Pipe but separate from metal pipes

#### Result

**Ontology State After Sentence 3:**

```
Classes (8):
  owl:Thing
    └─ Plumber ⭐
    └─ Pipe ⭐
        └─ PEXPipe ⭐
        └─ MetalPipe ⭐ [NEW - ABSTRACTION]
            └─ SteelPipe ⭐ [NEW]
    └─ Wall
    └─ WaterHeater
        └─ GasWaterHeater

Object Properties (4):
  kg:relatesTo (owl:Thing → owl:Thing)
    ├─ installs (Plumber → Pipe)
    ├─ installedIn (Pipe → Wall)
    ├─ connectsTo (PEXPipe → GasWaterHeater)

Datatype Properties (4):
  material (Pipe → xsd:string)
  buildingType (Wall → xsd:string)
  isGalvanized (SteelPipe → xsd:boolean) [NEW]
  corrosionLevel (SteelPipe → xsd:string) [NEW]
```

**Statistics:**
- Classes: 6 → 8 (+2: MetalPipe, SteelPipe)
- Properties: 2 → 4 (+2: isGalvanized, corrosionLevel)
- Relationships: 4 → 4 (no change)

**Key Observations:**

1. **Multi-Level Hierarchy**: Pipe → MetalPipe → SteelPipe (3 levels)
2. **Semantic Correctness**: MetalPipe separates metal-based from plastic-based pipes
3. **Property Specialization**: SteelPipe gets specific properties (isGalvanized, corrosionLevel)
4. **Abstraction Purpose**: MetalPipe groups similar materials, enabling future copper, brass, iron pipes

---

### Round 1 Summary

**Growth Over Round 1:**
```
Classes:     0 → 8  (+8)
Properties:  0 → 4  (+4)
Relationships: 0 → 4  (+4)
```

**Abstractions Created in Round 1:**
- **Plumber** (0 direct children, but foundation for future specializations)
- **Pipe** (2 children: PEXPipe, MetalPipe)

**Key Achievements:**

1. **Foundation Established**: Core plumbing vocabulary (Plumber, Pipe, Wall)
2. **Hierarchy Formation**: Multi-level pipe hierarchy (Pipe → MetalPipe → SteelPipe)
3. **Material Distinction**: Metal vs. plastic pipes properly categorized
4. **Appliance Category**: Water heater concepts introduced
5. **Universal Relationships**: kg:relatesTo bootstrapped and used consistently

**Domain Coverage:**
- ✅ Materials (copper, PEX, steel)
- ✅ Infrastructure (pipes, walls)
- ✅ Appliances (water heaters)
- ✅ Professionals (plumbers)

---

## Round 2: Tasks & Tools

> **Theme**: Expand beyond materials into the world of plumbing work - tasks, tools, fixtures, and maintenance activities.

---

### Sentence 4: Domain Expansion

#### Input
```
"The plumber repairs the leaking bathroom faucet."
```

#### Purpose
Expand the domain beyond materials and infrastructure into:
- **Tasks** (repairing)
- **Fixtures** (faucets)
- **Locations** (rooms like bathroom)
- **States** (leaking)

#### Processing

**Step 1: Entity Mention Extraction**

```json
{
  "mentions": ["plumber", "bathroom faucet", "faucet", "bathroom"]
}
```

**Step 2: Semantic Search**

```
→ Found 1 existing types (Plumber), 2 gaps (faucet, bathroom)
```

**Step 3: Type-Level Analysis**

```json
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "Plumber",
      "description": "Professional who repairs plumbing fixtures"
    },
    {
      "name": "Faucet",
      "description": "Plumbing fixture that controls water flow"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bathroom",
      "description": "Room containing plumbing fixtures"
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "isLeaking",
      "domain": "Faucet",
      "range": "xsd:boolean"
    },
    {
      "name": "location",
      "domain": "Faucet",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Dynamic Parent Determination - Faucet**

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_PARENT",
  "parentName": "PlumbingFixture",
  "parentDescription": "Device installed in plumbing system (faucets, sinks, toilets, etc.)",
  "grandparent": "owl:Thing",
  "reasoning": "Faucet is part of a broader category. PlumbingFixture parent allows for sinks, toilets, shower heads, etc."
}
```

**Why CREATE_PARENT?**
- Faucets are part of a larger category of plumbing fixtures
- Anticipates future fixture types (sinks, toilets, shower heads, valves, etc.)
- Creates proper semantic grouping for installed components

**Step 5: Dynamic Parent Determination - Bathroom**

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_PARENT",
  "parentName": "Room",
  "parentDescription": "Enclosed space within a building",
  "grandparent": "owl:Thing",
  "reasoning": "Bathroom is a specific type of room. Room parent allows for kitchen, utility room, etc."
}
```

**Why CREATE_PARENT?**
- Bathroom is one type of room
- Future sentences might mention kitchen, utility room, laundry room, etc.
- Proper abstraction for location types

#### Result

**Ontology State After Sentence 4:**

```

```

**Statistics:**
- Classes: 8 → 12 (+4: PlumbingFixture, Faucet, Room, Bathroom)
- Properties: 4 → 6 (+2: isLeaking, location)
- Relationships: 4 → 6 (+2: repairs, locatedIn)

**Key Observations:**

1. **Domain Expansion**: Beyond materials into fixtures and rooms
2. **Task Introduction**: "repairs" relationship captures maintenance work
3. **State Properties**: isLeaking captures fixture state
4. **Location Hierarchy**: Room → Bathroom enables future room types
5. **Fixture Hierarchy**: PlumbingFixture → Faucet enables future fixture types

### Sentence 5: Tool Category Introduction

#### Input
```
"The apprentice plumber clears the clogged kitchen drain with a drain snake."
```

#### Purpose
Introduce the **tool category** and demonstrate:
- Worker specialization (apprentice plumber)
- Tool usage patterns
- Different room types (kitchen)
- Different fixtures (drain)

#### Processing

**Step 1: Entity Mention Extraction**

```json
{
  "mentions": ["plumber", "apprentice plumber", "kitchen", "drain", "drain snake"]
}
```

**Step 2: Semantic Search**

```
→ Found 2 existing types (Plumber, possibly Room), 3 gaps (drain, drain snake, apprentice)
```

**Step 3: Type-Level Analysis**

```json
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "Plumber",
      "description": "Professional plumbing worker"
    },
    {
      "name": "Drain",
      "description": "Pipe system for removing water and waste"
    },
    {
      "name": "DrainSnake",
      "description": "Tool used to clear blocked drains"
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "isApprentice",
      "domain": "Plumber",
      "range": "xsd:boolean"
    },
    {
      "name": "isClogged",
      "domain": "Drain",
      "range": "xsd:boolean"
    },
    {
      "name": "toolType",
      "domain": "DrainSnake",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Dynamic Parent Determination - Drain**

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_PARENT",
  "parentName": "DrainageSystem",
  "parentDescription": "System for removing water and waste from buildings",
  "grandparent": "owl:Thing",
  "reasoning": "Drain is part of broader drainage infrastructure. DrainageSystem groups drains, waste lines, vent pipes, etc."
}
```

**Step 5: Dynamic Parent Determination - DrainSnake**

**This is the KEY moment for tool abstraction!**

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_PARENT",
  "parentName": "PlumbingTool",
  "parentDescription": "Tools used for plumbing work",
  "grandparent": "owl:Thing",
  "reasoning": "DrainSnake is a plumbing tool. PlumbingTool parent allows for wrenches, cutters, soldering tools, etc."
}
```

**Why This Matters:**

This is the **first tool introduced**. The LLM proactively creates `PlumbingTool` as an abstraction, anticipating:
- Pipe wrenches
- Cutting tools
- Measuring tools
- Soldering equipment
- etc.

This sets up the next sentence to demonstrate sibling recognition.

1. **Tool Category Established**: PlumbingTool parent created proactively
2. **Tool Usage Pattern**: Dual relationships (usesTool, clearedWith) show tool interactions
3. **Worker Specialization**: isApprentice property added to Plumber
4. **Drainage System**: New infrastructure category introduced
5. **Cross-Domain Relationships**: Tools relate to both workers (usesTool) and fixtures (clearedWith)

### Sentence 6: Tool Abstraction

#### Input
```
"The pipe wrench tightens the threaded pipe connection joint."
```

#### Purpose
Demonstrate that when a **second tool is added** (PipeWrench), the system recognizes it belongs to the same category and uses the existing PlumbingTool parent.

#### Processing

**Step 1: Entity Mention Extraction**

```json
{
  "mentions": ["pipe wrench", "wrench", "pipe", "connection", "joint", "threaded pipe"]
}
```

**Step 2: Semantic Search**

```
→ Found 1 existing types (Pipe), 6 gaps
```

**Step 3: Type-Level Analysis**

```json
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "PipeWrench",
      "description": "Tool used for gripping and turning pipes"
    },
    {
      "name": "PipeConnection",
      "description": "Joint or connection point between pipes"
    },
    {
      "name": "ThreadedPipe",
      "description": "Pipe with spiral threading for screwing connections"
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "threadType",
      "domain": "ThreadedPipe",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    },
    {
      "name": "torqueLevel",
      "domain": "PipeConnection",
      "range": "xsd:string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Dynamic Parent Determination - PipeWrench**

**This is the CRITICAL decision point!**

The system now has:
- Existing PlumbingTool parent (created in sentence 5)
- Existing child: DrainSnake
- New class: PipeWrench

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "USE_EXISTING",
  "parent": "kg:PlumbingTool",
  "reasoning": "PipeWrench is clearly a plumbing tool, similar to DrainSnake. Using existing PlumbingTool parent."
}
```

**Why USE_EXISTING?**
- PlumbingTool parent already exists
- PipeWrench and DrainSnake are both tools used by plumbers
- No need to create another level of abstraction
- This demonstrates **sibling recognition** - the system understands PipeWrench and DrainSnake are peers

**Step 5: Dynamic Parent Determination - PipeConnection**

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "CREATE_PARENT",
  "parentName": "PlumbingConnection",
  "parentDescription": "Joints and fittings that connect plumbing components",
  "grandparent": "owl:Thing",
  "reasoning": "PipeConnection is part of connection infrastructure. PlumbingConnection groups joints, fittings, couplings, etc."
}
```

**Step 6: Dynamic Parent Determination - ThreadedPipe**

**LLM Decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "USE_EXISTING",
  "parent": "kg:MetalPipe",
  "reasoning": "ThreadedPipe is typically metal (for threading). MetalPipe is appropriate parent."
}
```

**Why This is Smart:**
- Threaded pipes are almost always metal (steel, brass, etc.)
- The LLM correctly identifies this goes under MetalPipe, not just Pipe
- Shows semantic understanding of material properties

#### Result

## Key Innovations Demonstrated

### 1. Dynamic Abstraction Creation

**Examples:**
- **Sentence 2**: Created `WaterHeater` parent proactively (even with only 1 child)
- **Sentence 3**: Created `MetalPipe` to separate metal from plastic pipes
- **Sentence 4**: Created `PlumbingFixture` and `Room` parents
- **Sentence 5**: Created `PlumbingTool` parent for first tool

**Why This Matters:**
- System doesn't wait for multiple siblings to exist
- LLM anticipates future domain growth
- Creates semantically meaningful categories

### 2. Sibling Recognition and Reuse

**Example:**
- **Sentence 5**: Creates `PlumbingTool` parent for DrainSnake
- **Sentence 6**: Recognizes PipeWrench is a sibling, uses existing PlumbingTool parent

**Why This Matters:**
- System learns from previous sentences
- Recognizes patterns across inputs
- Avoids creating duplicate abstractions

### 3. Multi-Level Hierarchies

**Example:**
```
Pipe (level 1)
└─ MetalPipe (level 2)
    ├─ SteelPipe (level 3)
    └─ ThreadedPipe (level 3)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Not just flat parent-child relationships
- Creates proper taxonomic depth
- Enables fine-grained categorization

### 4. Universal Relationship Hierarchy

**Structure:**
```
kg:relatesTo (owl:Thing → owl:Thing)
├─ installs (Plumber → Pipe)
├─ repairs (Plumber → Faucet)
├─ usesTool (Plumber → DrainSnake)
└─ ... (all 10 relationships)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Every relationship has a common parent
- Enables subsumption reasoning
- Allows queries like "show me all relationships between any two things"

### 5. Semantic Material Intelligence

**Example:**
- Sentence 6: `ThreadedPipe` placed under `MetalPipe` (not generic `Pipe`)
- LLM understands threaded pipes are typically metal

**Why This Matters:**
- Not just pattern matching
- Leverages world knowledge
- Semantically correct categorization

### 6. Progressive Domain Building

**Round 1**: Foundation (materials, infrastructure)
**Round 2**: Activities (tasks, tools, maintenance)

**Why This Matters:**
- System builds incrementally
- Each round builds on previous knowledge
- Enables step-by-step domain growth

### 7. Cross-Domain Relationships

**Examples:**
- `usesTool`: Plumber → DrainSnake (worker → tool)
- `clearedWith`: Drain → DrainSnake (fixture → tool)
- `tightens`: PipeWrench → PipeConnection (tool → component)

**Why This Matters:**
- Relationships span multiple categories
- Captures real-world interactions
- Enables complex queries

## Technical Architecture

### 5-Phase Pipeline

Every sentence goes through this pipeline:

1. **QUERY PHASE**: Extract entity mentions, search for existing types
2. **GAP ANALYSIS**: Identify what's new vs. what exists
3. **DECISION PHASE**: LLM determines parents (USE_EXISTING or CREATE_PARENT)
4. **EXTENSION PHASE**: Add new classes, properties, relationships
5. **ANNOTATION PHASE**: Index in semantic search for future queries

### LLM Interaction Points

**3 Prompt Templates Used:**

1. **mention-extraction.hbs**: Extract entity type mentions
   ```
   Input: "The plumber repairs the leaking bathroom faucet."
   Output: ["plumber", "bathroom faucet", "faucet", "bathroom"]
   ```

2. **type-extraction.hbs**: Extract type-level information
   ```
   Input: Sentence + existing ontology
   Output: {classes: [...], properties: [...]}
   ```

3. **determine-parent-with-abstraction.hbs**: Decide parent class
   ```
   Input: New class + existing classes + domain
   Output: {action: "USE_EXISTING" | "CREATE_PARENT", parent: "...", reasoning: "..."}
   ```

### Semantic Search Integration

**Qdrant Vector Database:**
- Stores embeddings of all classes
- Similarity threshold: 0.75
- Uses Nomic embeddings (local, fast)

**Example:**
- Search for "pipe" → finds existing `kg:Pipe` class
- Search for "drain snake" → no match (new concept)

### RDF/OWL Representation

**Triple Store:**
- Uses `SimpleTripleStore` (in-memory RDF store)
- Standard RDF/OWL predicates:
  - `rdf:type`
  - `rdfs:subClassOf`
  - `rdfs:subPropertyOf`
  - `rdfs:domain`, `rdfs:range`
  - `rdfs:label`, `rdfs:comment`

**Example Triples:**
```turtle
kg:PipeWrench rdf:type owl:Class .
kg:PipeWrench rdfs:subClassOf kg:PlumbingTool .
kg:PipeWrench rdfs:label "PipeWrench" .
kg:PipeWrench rdfs:comment "Tool used for gripping and turning pipes" .
```

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **LLM-Driven Intelligence**: The system autonomously decides when to create abstractions, use existing parents, or specialize classes

2. **Progressive Domain Building**: Round 1 establishes foundation (materials), Round 2 adds activities (tools, tasks)

3. **Semantic Correctness**: Multi-level hierarchies (Pipe→MetalPipe→SteelPipe) reflect real-world taxonomies

4. **Cross-Domain Relationships**: Tools relate to workers, fixtures, and components in meaningful ways

5. **Universal Relationship Hierarchy**: All relationships inherit from `kg:relatesTo`, enabling powerful reasoning

6. **Incremental Growth**: From 0 to 20 classes, demonstrating the system works from empty ontology to rich domain model

The system is ready for:
- **Domain Expansion**: Add more sentences to grow the ontology
- **Multiple Domains**: Apply same approach to other domains (medical, legal, manufacturing, etc.)
- **Query & Reasoning**: Use the ontology for semantic search, inference, and knowledge retrieval
- **Integration**: Connect with other Legion components (agents, tools, workflows)
