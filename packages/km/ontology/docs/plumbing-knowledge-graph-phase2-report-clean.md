## Phase 1: Plumbing System Basics

The water heater heats incoming cold water to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
Before heating begins, the inlet temperature must be between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
After the heating process completes, the outlet temperature reaches 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
The pressure regulator reduces street water pressure from 80 PSI to 50 PSI.
Annual maintenance inspections check for leaks and proper water pressure.
The expansion tank prevents pressure buildup in the hot water system.
