You are an ontology design expert. Your task is to determine the best RDF/OWL modeling pattern for a document, considering what already exists in the ontology.

TASK:
Determine the best modeling pattern for this document. Consider:

1. What is the PRIMARY PATTERN this document requires?
   Examples:
   - "Observation Pattern" - for measurements/metrics over time periods
   - "Event Pattern" - for temporal events with participants
   - "Classification Pattern" - for taxonomies and categories
   - "Document Pattern" - for documents with sections and content

2. WHY is this pattern appropriate?
   - What characteristics of the document drive this choice?
   - How does it handle the document's structure (table, narrative, temporal, etc.)?

3. What CONCEPTS are required for this pattern?
   For each concept, specify:
   - Name: Concept name (e.g., "MetricObservation")
   - Type: "class", "property", or "relationship"
   - Purpose: Why this concept is needed

   Example for Observation Pattern:
   - Organization (class): Represents the entity being measured
   - Period (class): Represents time periods
   - FinancialMetric (class): Types of metrics
   - MetricObservation (class): Individual measurements
   - forOrganization (relationship): Links observation to organization
   - forPeriod (relationship): Links observation to period
   - hasMetricType (relationship): Links observation to metric type
   - hasValue (property): Stores the numeric value

4. What EXISTING concepts can be REUSED?
   List URIs of existing classes/properties/relationships that fit this pattern.
   Examples:
   - "kg:Organization" (already defined)
   - "kg:FinancialReport" (already defined)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Tables with metrics × periods → Use Observation Pattern
- Temporal data → Ensure Period/Time entities
- Quantitative data → Ensure value properties with xsd:decimal range
- Multi-dimensional data → Use observation pattern, not flat properties
- ALWAYS reuse existing concepts when they fit!

Provide your response as a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

{
  "name": "Observation Pattern",
  "reason": "This pattern is appropriate because the document contains a financial table with metrics across multiple time periods. The Observation Pattern allows us to represent each cell as a distinct observation linking organization, period, metric type, and value.",
  "requiredConcepts": [
    {
      "name": "Organization",
      "type": "class",
      "purpose": "Represents the company being measured"
    },
    {
      "name": "Period",
      "type": "class",
      "purpose": "Represents time periods (years)"
    },
    {
      "name": "MetricObservation",
      "type": "class",
      "purpose": "Represents individual measurements"
    },
    {
      "name": "forOrganization",
      "type": "relationship",
      "purpose": "Links observation to organization"
    },
    {
      "name": "forPeriod",
      "type": "relationship",
      "purpose": "Links observation to period"
    },
    {
      "name": "hasValue",
      "type": "property",
      "purpose": "Stores numeric value"
    }
  ],
  "reuseExisting": []
}
