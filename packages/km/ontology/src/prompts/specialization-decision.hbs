Sentence: "{{sentence}}"

Implied {{type}}: {{impliedName}}
Existing in hierarchy: {{existingLabel}} (defined in {{definedIn}}, {{inheritanceDistance}} levels up)

Should we:
A) REUSE the inherited concept (sufficient for this use case)
B) SPECIALIZE by creating a sub{{type}} (if domain-specific semantics needed)

Only specialize if the domain requires specific semantics not captured by the parent.

Examples:

1. REUSE case:
   Sentence: "The pump is located in Building A"
   Implied: locatedIn
   Existing: locatedIn (defined in PhysicalObject)
   Decision: REUSE - generic location property is sufficient

2. SPECIALIZE case:
   Sentence: "The pump installation location must meet safety requirements"
   Implied: installationLocation
   Existing: locatedIn (defined in PhysicalObject)
   Decision: SPECIALIZE - installation-specific location has different semantics (safety requirements, regulatory compliance)

Return JSON with:
- action: "REUSE" or "SPECIALIZE"
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why
