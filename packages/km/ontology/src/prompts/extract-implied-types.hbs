Analyze this sentence and extract TYPE-LEVEL information (not instances):

Sentence: "{{sentence}}"

Extract:
1. Entity types (e.g., "compressor", "heat exchanger")
2. Properties implied (e.g., "operates at pressure" → operatingPressure property)
3. Relationships (e.g., "connects to" → connectsTo relationship)

UPPER-LEVEL CATEGORIES:
All entities must be categorized as one of:
- PhysicalEntity: Physical objects (equipment, components, materials) - things you can touch
- State: Conditions, configurations, situations (temperature=150°F, valve open, pressure level)
- Process: Natural or industrial transformations (heating, cooling, pumping, mixing)
- Task: Planned activities (maintenance, inspection, calibration, repair)

Return JSON with:
- classes: Array of {name, suggestedSupertype, definition, supertypeDescription, usageDescription, synonyms} for entity types
- properties: Array of {name, domain, type} for datatype properties
- relationships: Array of {name, domain, range, definition, supertypeDescription, usageDescription, synonyms} for object properties

For each class, include:
- suggestedSupertype: One of "PhysicalEntity", "State", "Process", or "Task" (REQUIRED)
  * Use PhysicalEntity for tangible objects (pump, tank, valve, pipe)
  * Use State for conditions/situations (temperature, pressure, valve position, operational mode)
  * Use Process for transformations/operations (heating, pumping, mixing, flowing)
  * Use Task for planned activities (maintenance, inspection, calibration)

For each entity/relationship, generate 4 perspectives:
1. definition: Primary formal definition (2-3 sentences, detailed)
2. supertypeDescription: Description in terms of supertype category (e.g., "A type of {supertype} that...")
3. usageDescription: Purpose or usage context (e.g., "Used for...", "Performs...", "Enables...")
4. synonyms: Comma-separated list of alternative phrasings, variations, and ways this concept might be mentioned

Example:
Sentence: "The centrifugal pump operates at 150 PSI and connects to the tank"
