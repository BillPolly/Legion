New class: {{newClassName}} - {{newClassDescription}}

Domain: {{domain}}

Existing classes in ontology:
{{#if existingClasses}}
{{#each existingClasses}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
(No existing classes - ontology is empty)
{{/if}}

Which class should be the parent (rdfs:subClassOf) for this new class?

Choose the most specific appropriate parent based on IS-A relationship.
- If ontology is empty, return "owl:Thing"
- If none of the existing classes fit, return "owl:Thing"
- Only return a class that exists in the list above or "owl:Thing"

Examples:

1. New class: "Pump", Existing: ["kg:Equipment", "kg:PhysicalObject"]
   → Parent: "kg:Equipment" (Pump IS-A Equipment)

2. New class: "CentrifugalPump", Existing: ["kg:Pump", "kg:Equipment"]
   → Parent: "kg:Pump" (CentrifugalPump IS-A Pump)

3. New class: "Equipment", Existing: []
   → Parent: "owl:Thing" (first class in ontology)

Return JSON with:
- parentClass: The URI of the parent class (e.g., "kg:Equipment" or "owl:Thing")
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why this parent was chosen
