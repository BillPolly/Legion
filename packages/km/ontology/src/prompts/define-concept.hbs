   {{#if concept.type}}
   {{#if (eq concept.type "class")}}
   - MUST be one of: kg:PhysicalEntity, kg:State, kg:Process, kg:Task, or owl:Thing
   - Choose based on: PhysicalEntity (material objects), State (conditions), Process (activities), Task (planned activities)
   {{else}}
   - For properties and relationships, use: owl:Thing
   {{/if}}
   {{/if}}

{{#if (or (eq concept.type "property") (eq concept.type "relationship"))}}
8. **Domain**: What class does this property/relationship apply to?
   - MUST be one of the AVAILABLE CLASSES listed above

   {{#if (eq concept.type "relationship")}}
   - For object properties: MUST be one of the AVAILABLE CLASSES listed above
   - Format: "kg:ClassName"
   {{/if}}
{{/if}}

IMPORTANT: The URI field must EXACTLY match kg:{{concept.name}}. Do not modify the concept name in any way.

EXAMPLES:

For class "MetricObservation":
{
  "uri": "kg:MetricObservation",
  "label": "Metric Observation",
  "definition": "A recorded measurement of a specific financial metric for an organization during a particular period. Represents a single data point in a financial dataset.",
  "supertypeDescription": "A type of state that captures the condition or performance of an organization at a point in time",
  "usageDescription": "Used to represent individual cells in financial tables, where each observation links an organization, period, metric type, and numeric value",
  "synonyms": "measurement, data point, metric value, observation",
  "parent": "kg:State"
}

For property "hasValue" (note: URI is exactly kg:hasValue):
{
  "uri": "kg:hasValue",
  "label": "has value",
  "definition": "Associates a metric observation with its numeric value",
  "supertypeDescription": "A datatype property that stores quantitative measurements",
  "usageDescription": "Used to attach the actual numeric value to a metric observation",
  "synonyms": "value, amount, quantity",
  "parent": "owl:Thing",
  "domain": "kg:MetricObservation",
  "range": "xsd:decimal"
}

For relationship "forOrganization" (note: URI is exactly kg:forOrganization):
{
  "uri": "kg:forOrganization",
  "label": "for organization",
  "definition": "Links a metric observation to the organization being measured",
  "supertypeDescription": "An object property that establishes the subject of a measurement",
  "usageDescription": "Used to specify which organization a metric observation pertains to",
  "synonyms": "about organization, pertains to organization, measures organization",
  "parent": "owl:Thing",
  "domain": "kg:MetricObservation",
  "range": "kg:Organization"
}
