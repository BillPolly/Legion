# Query Understanding System - Implementation Plan

**Package**: `@legion/km/query-understanding`
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development (no refactor phase - get it right first time)
**Strategy**: 80/20 rule - build core mechanisms first, then elaborate
**Quality**: 100% test pass rate, no skips, no fallbacks, FAIL FAST

---

## Overview

This plan implements the 4-phase natural language query understanding pipeline as specified in `DESIGN.md`. Each phase builds on the previous, with comprehensive testing at every step.

**Key Principles:**
- Build incrementally in natural dependency order
- Test thoroughly before moving forward (unit → integration → e2e)
- No mocks in integration tests (only for peripheral concerns)
- No fallbacks in implementation - FAIL FAST
- Every phase delivers demonstrable value
- Read DESIGN.md at each phase for implementation details

**Testing Rules:**
- ✅ Unit tests: Can use mocks for external dependencies
- ✅ Integration tests: Real services only (LLM, semantic search, MongoDB, Qdrant)
- ✅ All resources available in .env (API keys, database URLs)
- ✅ No skipping tests - they must pass or fail
- ✅ No fallback logic - explicit errors only

---

## Phase 0: Foundation & Schemas

### Purpose
Establish package structure, schemas, and validation infrastructure before implementing pipeline logic.

### Steps

- [ ] **0.1**: Read DESIGN.md Section "Data Contracts" and "Architecture Overview"

- [ ] **0.2**: Create package structure
  - Create `/packages/km/query-understanding` directory
  - Set up `package.json` with dependencies
  - Configure Jest for ES6 modules (no concurrent tests)
  - Add workspace imports for `@legion/schema`, `@legion/resource-manager`, `@legion/prompting`, `@legion/semantic-search`

- [ ] **0.3**: Define JSON schemas
  - Create `/schemas/CanonicalQuestion.schema.json` (from DESIGN.md Appendix)
  - Create `/schemas/NPVP_AST.schema.json` (from DESIGN.md Section "Phase 2 Output")
  - Create `/schemas/LogicalSkeleton.schema.json` (from DESIGN.md Section "Phase 3 Output")
  - Create `/schemas/AmbiguityReport.schema.json` (from DESIGN.md Section "Phase 3 Output")

- [ ] **0.4**: Unit test schemas
  - Test CanonicalQuestion validation with valid/invalid inputs
  - Test NPVP_AST validation with valid/invalid tree structures
  - Test LogicalSkeleton validation with valid/invalid atoms
  - Test AmbiguityReport validation
  - All tests must use `@legion/schema` validator
  - FAIL FAST on validation errors

- [ ] **0.5**: Create base pipeline class
  - Create `src/QueryUnderstandingPipeline.js` with constructor and initialize method
  - Accept ResourceManager in constructor
  - Accept dataSource option in initialize (specifies which DataSource to use)
  - Write unit tests for initialization
  - FAIL if ResourceManager not provided or not initialized
  - FAIL if DataSource not available

**Deliverable**: Working package with validated schemas, ready for phase implementations

  - Validates complete data flow

**Deliverable**: ✅ E2E pipeline integration validated - 3/3 tests passing

**Test Results**:
```
Complete Pipeline: "Which countries border Germany?"
  ✓ should process question through all 4 phases (3421ms)

Error Handling
  ✓ should handle invalid question gracefully (1823ms)
  ✓ should handle unmapped tokens in Phase 3 (1156ms)
```

**Example Output** (from E2E test logs):
```json
Phase 1 (RewriteResolver): {
  "text": "Which countries border Germany?",
  "wh_role": "which",
  "entity_map": { "Germany": ":Germany" }
}

Phase 2 (NPVPParser): {
  "S": {
    "NP": { "Det": "which", "Head": "countries", "Mods": [] },
    "VP": { "Verb": "border", "Comps": [{"NP": { "Head": "Germany" }}], "Mods": [] },
    "Force": "ask"
  }
}

Phase 3 (TreeWalker + ConstraintPropagator): {
  "vars": ["?x"],
  "atoms": [
    ["isa", "?x", ":Country"],
    ["rel", ":borders", "?x", ":Germany"]
  ],
  "project": ["?x"],
  "force": "select"
}

Phase 4 (DataScriptConverter): {
  "find": ["?x"],
  "where": [
    ["?x", ":type", ":Country"],
    ["?x", ":borders", ":Germany"]
  ]
}

## Phase 6: Example Ontologies & Validation ✅ PARTIAL (Geography validated)

### Purpose
Create sample ontologies for testing and validate system across domains.

### Steps

- [x] **6.1**: Read DESIGN.md Section "Examples" and "Testing Strategy"

- [x] **6.2**: Create geography ontology ✅
  - Created `examples/ontologies/geography.js` (JavaScript format for easy integration)
  - Defined 7 classes: Country, City, River, Mountain, Continent, Ocean, Lake
  - Defined 8 properties: borders, capital, population, area, locatedIn, flowsThrough, height, length
  - Defined 32 individuals: Countries (Germany, France, Italy, etc.), Cities (Berlin, Paris, Rome, etc.), Rivers (Rhine, Danube, Seine), Mountains (Mont Blanc, Matterhorn), Continents (Europe, Asia, North America)
  - All indexed with semantic search (37 vectors in Qdrant)
  - Includes rich synonyms and aliases for robust mapping

- [x] **6.5**: Test geography domain ✅ 3/3 PASSING
  - Created `__tests__/domains/geography.integration.test.js`
  - Tests border questions: "Which countries border Germany?", "What countries neighbor France?"
  - Tests count questions: "How many countries are in Europe?"
  - All tests pass with complete pipeline (Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
  - Demonstrates synonym mapping ("neighbor" → :borders)
  - Demonstrates aggregation queries (COUNT)
  - Real LLM + Real semantic search + Real Qdrant - NO MOCKS

**Test Results**:
```
Geography Domain Integration
  Border Questions
    ✓ should answer: "Which countries border Germany?" (3603ms)
    ✓ should answer: "What countries neighbor France?" (3631ms)
  Count Questions
    ✓ should answer: "How many countries are in Europe?" (4452ms)
```

**Example Query Output** (from "Which countries border Germany?"):
```json
{
  "find": ["?x"],
  "where": [
    ["?x", ":type", ":Country"],
    ["?x", ":borders", ":Germany"]
  ]
}
```

**Deliverable**: ✅ Geography domain validated with sample ontology - 3/3 tests passing

**MVP Scope Note**: This MVP focuses on transitive verb constructions ("X verb Y"). Copula constructions ("What is the X of Y?") and complex prepositional phrases ("in France", "through Germany") require additional TreeWalker enhancements and are deferred to future phases.

**Remaining Steps** (deferred as MVP is functionally complete):
- [ ] **6.3**: Create finance ontology (future enhancement)
- [ ] **6.4**: Create biography ontology (future enhancement)
- [ ] **6.6**: Test finance domain (future enhancement)

## Notes for Implementers

1. **Read DESIGN.md at each phase** - All implementation details are there
2. **No mocks in integration tests** - Use real ResourceManager services
3. **No fallbacks** - Explicit errors only, FAIL FAST
4. **Schema validation always** - Use `@legion/schema` at phase boundaries
5. **Test before proceeding** - Don't move to next step until tests pass
6. **80/20 rule** - Build core first, elaborate later
7. **Demonstrable value** - Each phase should work end-to-end for its scope

---

**IMPORTANT**: This is an MVP focused on functional correctness and capabilities only. No NFRs (security, performance optimization, migration strategies, deployment, publishing) are in scope. All testing is local with real services from .env and docker-compose.
