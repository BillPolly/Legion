# Complete Demo with Answers

This demo shows the **full cycle** of the Query Understanding System:

```
Natural Language Question → DataScript Query → Execution → Real Answers
```

## What This Demo Does

1. **Loads sample geography data** from JSON (8 countries with border relationships)
2. **Processes natural language questions** through all 4 phases
3. **Executes generated queries** against the data
4. **Returns actual answers** - not just queries!

## Files

- `demo.js` - Main demo script
- `data.json` - Sample geography data (countries, borders, populations)
- `simple-json-executor.js` - Simple query executor for JSON data

## Running the Demo

```bash
node examples/complete-demo-with-answers/demo.js
```

## Sample Output

```
❓ QUESTION: "Which countries border Germany?"

【Phase 1: Normalization】
✓ Canonical: "which countries border Germany?"
✓ Entities: Germany → :Germany

【Phase 2: Parsing】
✓ Structure: [which] countries border ...

【Phase 3: Semantic Mapping】
✓ Variables: ?x
✓ Atoms:
  - ISA: ?x :Country
  - REL: :borders ?x :Germany

【Phase 4: Query Generation】
✓ DataScript Query:
{
  "find": ["?x"],
  "where": [
    ["?x", ":type", ":Country"],
    ["?x", ":borders", ":Germany"]
  ]
}

【Execution】
🔍 Executing query against data...

📋 ANSWER:
✅ Found 5 result(s):
  1. France (pop: 67,000,000)
  2. Poland (pop: 38,000,000)
  3. Austria (pop: 9,000,000)
  4. Switzerland (pop: 8,700,000)
  5. Belgium (pop: 11,500,000)
```

## Three Questions Demonstrated

### 1. "Which countries border Germany?"
**Answer:** France, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium

### 2. "What countries neighbor France?"
**Answer:** Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium
**Note:** Shows synonym mapping - "neighbor" → `:borders`

### 3. "How many countries are in Europe?"
**Answer:** 8 countries (from our sample data)
**Note:** Shows aggregation query (COUNT)

## Key Features Shown

✅ **Entity Recognition**: "Germany" → `:Germany`
✅ **Synonym Mapping**: "neighbor" → `:borders`
✅ **Semantic Mapping**: "countries" → `:Country`
✅ **Query Generation**: Natural language → DataScript
✅ **Query Execution**: DataScript → Results
✅ **Actual Answers**: Real data returned!

## Data Structure

The `data.json` file contains:

```json
{
  "countries": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "Country",
      "name": "Germany",
      "population": 83000000,
      "area": 357022,
      "continent": "Europe",
      "borders": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## How Execution Works

The `SimpleJSONExecutor` class:

1. Parses DataScript queries
2. Filters JSON data based on query constraints
3. Handles aggregations (COUNT, SUM, etc.)
4. Returns matching results

**Note:** In production, you would use:
- `DataStoreDataSource` for MongoDB/Datalog
- `TripleStoreDataSource` for SPARQL
- `GraphDataSource` for Neo4j/Cypher

This demo uses simple JSON for clarity and portability.

## What This Proves

🎯 The system successfully:
- Understands natural language questions
- Converts them to executable queries
- Returns real answers from data
- Works end-to-end without human intervention

## Next Steps

To integrate with real databases:

1. **MongoDB**: Use `DataStoreDataSource` from `@legion/data-proxies`
2. **SPARQL/RDF**: Use `TripleStoreDataSource`
3. **Neo4j**: Use `GraphDataSource`

The DataScript format is the same - only the executor changes!
