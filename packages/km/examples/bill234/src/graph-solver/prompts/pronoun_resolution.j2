TASK: Resolve ALL pronouns and temporal references to explicit values.

PRONOUNS TO RESOLVE:
- "it" → Replace with what "it" refers to
- "this", "that" → Replace with what they refer to
- "they", "them" → Replace with what group they refer to
- "these", "those" → Replace with what items they refer to

TEMPORAL REFERENCES TO RESOLVE:
- "this year", "that year" → Replace with actual year number (e.g., 2004)
- "this period", "that period" → Replace with actual period (e.g., "2004 to 2009")
- "current year" → Replace with actual year from context

RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
1. Look at the MOST RECENT RESULT - pronouns usually refer to it
2. Read the Question and Description to understand what was computed
3. If "it" refers to the SAME METRIC TYPE for a different entity, explain this clearly

OUTPUT (JSON):
{
  "resolved_question": "the question with all pronouns replaced with explicit references",
  "resolutions": {
    "it": "what it was replaced with",
    "this": "what this was replaced with"
  },
  "confidence": 0.95
