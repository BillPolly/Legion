You are analyzing a financial table to extract semantic understanding.

You have been given the PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURE of a table (columns, rows, cells extracted by code).
Your job is to add SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING by analyzing the structure + surrounding text.

TABLE STRUCTURE (extracted programmatically):
==========================================

Orientation: {{ structure.orientation }}

Columns ({{ structure.columns|length }}):
{% for col in structure.columns %}
  {{ col.index }}. "{{ col.label }}"
{% endfor %}

Rows ({{ structure.rows|length }}):
{% for row in structure.rows %}
  {{ row.index }}. "{{ row.label }}"
{% endfor %}

Cells: {{ structure.cells|length }} values

SURROUNDING TEXT:
================
{{ text[:2000] }}
...

YOUR TASK:
=========

Provide semantic understanding of this table:

1. **Table Caption/Title**: What is this table showing? Look for context in the text.

2. **Units**: What are the default units for values in this table?
   - Look for phrases like "in thousands", "in millions", "in billions"
   - If not specified, assume "Units"
   - Return one of: "Units", "Thousands", "Millions", "Billions"

3. **Column Semantics**: For EACH column (by index), provide:
   - `semantic_type`: One of:
     * "Year" - Column represents a time period/year
     * "Category" - Column represents a category (e.g., "residential", "commercial")
     * "EntityType" - Column represents different entities (e.g., "class a stock", "class b stock")
     * "Metric" - Column represents different metrics
   - `description`: Brief description of what this column represents

4. **Row Semantics**: For EACH row (by index), provide:
   - `semantic_type`: One of:
     * "DataPoint" - A source data point from the table
     * "CalculatedTotal" - A calculated total/sum
     * "Subtotal" - A subtotal within a category
     * "Header" - A header/section divider
   - `description`: Brief description of what this row represents
   - `temporal_info` (optional): If row references dates/years, extract them as dict
     Example: {"year": 2017, "date": "july 3 2017"}

5. **Text Metrics**: Extract financial metrics mentioned in the SURROUNDING TEXT that are NOT in the table.
   - Look for phrases like:
     * "we are authorized to issue 2 billion shares"
     * "total assets were $10.5 billion"
     * "net income of $318 million for fiscal 2018"
   - For each metric, provide:
     * `metric_name`: Descriptive name
     * `value`: Numeric value
     * `scale`: "Units", "Thousands", "Millions", or "Billions"
     * `source_text`: The exact text snippet (for verification)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Base your analysis on the LABELS and SURROUNDING TEXT
- Don't make up information - if unclear, make best judgment
- For temporal_info, extract actual dates/years mentioned in row labels
- Text metrics should be ADDITIONAL metrics not already in the table structure

Return your analysis as structured JSON matching the TableSemantics model.
