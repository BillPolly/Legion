**CRITICAL FOR SEMANTIC MATCHING:**
These footnotes explain what table metrics SEMANTICALLY represent.
When a question asks for "contractual principal, interest and fees", check if any metric footnote defines that phrase!
Example: If footnote says "outstanding balance (a) represents the sum of contractual principal, interest and fees"
  → Then "outstanding balance (a)" IS what the question is asking for!
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

TASK:
For each value above, extract the specific numeric value and scale from the TABLE DATA.

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Simple metric with year:
Description: "compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015"
Looking for: Row where "metric" contains "compensation expense" (but NOT "unrecognized")
```json
{
  "metric": "compensation expense related to stock awards",
  "2013": {"value": 44.0, "scale": "Millions"},
  "2014": {"value": 34.0, "scale": "Millions"},
  "2015": {"value": 43.0, "scale": "Millions"}
}
```
Extract: row["2015"]["value"] = 43.0, scale = "Millions"
NOT: "unrecognized compensation expense" (this is FUTURE expense, not recorded)

Example 2 - Total metric:
Description: "total obligations due"
Looking for: Row where "metric" exactly matches "total" (if it exists)
```json
{
  "metric": "total",
  "2015": {"value": 317105.0, "scale": "Thousands"}
}
```
Extract: row["2015"]["value"] = 317105.0, scale = "Thousands"

Example 3 - Temporal balance:
Description: "balance of allowance for loan and lease losses as of december 31, 2014"
Looking for: Row where "metric" contains "december 31" (the DATE is the metric label)
```json
{
  "metric": "december 31, 2014",
  "balance": {"value": 3331.0, "scale": "Millions"}
}
```
Extract: row["balance"]["value"] = 3331.0, scale = "Millions"

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Each row in the JSON array represents one metric/line item from the table
- The "metric" field contains the row label (e.g., metric name, date, category)
- Other fields are column names with {value, scale} objects
- To extract a value: find the right row, then access the right column

SEMANTIC MATCHING STRATEGY:
1. **START BROAD**: Filter rows by keyword (e.g., rows where metric contains "compensation expense")
2. **NARROW DOWN**: Use semantic context to pick the RIGHT row:
   - "compensation expense" (recorded) ≠ "unrecognized compensation expense" (future)
   - "total debt" (aggregate) ≠ "debt due in 1-3 years" (subset)
   - "december 31, 2014" (end of year) ≠ "january 1, 2014" (start of year)
3. **EXTRACT VALUE**: Access the correct column from the selected row

Example workflow for "compensation expense in 2015":
```
Step 1: Filter rows → [{metric: "compensation expense related to stock awards"},
                        {metric: "unrecognized compensation expense associated with rpsrs"}]
Step 2: Pick correct row → "compensation expense related to stock awards" (recorded, not unrecognized)
Step 3: Extract value → row["2015"]["value"] = 43.0
```

CRITICAL - EXACT MATCH VS AGGREGATION:
1. **PREFER EXACT MATCHES for "total"**: If looking for "total [metric]", check if a row or column is LITERALLY labeled "total"
2. **GRAND TOTAL (both dimensions)**: If BOTH Row Labels AND Column Labels contain "total", use that cell
3. **Use aggregation ONLY when "total" is NOT a table label**: If description says "sum of X and Y", add the values
4. **DO NOT over-aggregate**: If a "total" row/column exists, don't sum detail rows

CRITICAL - TEMPORAL BALANCE LOOKUPS ("as of" pattern):
When description contains "as of [specific date]" (e.g., "as of december 31", "as of january 1"):
- This asks for a balance VALUE at a specific date
- The TABLE ROW (or column) is the DATE, not the metric name
- Example: "balance of allowance for loan and lease losses as of december 31, 2014"
  * Look for row: "december 31, 2014" or "december 31" with year context
  * NOT row: "allowance for loan and lease losses"

CRITICAL - PERFORMANCE/RETURN TABLES:
When the table caption contains "cumulative total return", "performance", "stock performance", or "investment growth":
- The values shown in the table ARE the return/performance metrics
- Questions like "value of an investment in [company] in [year]" refer to the return INDEX VALUE shown in the table
- These tables show indexed returns (typically starting at 100 in base year)
- Example: "what is the value of an investment in edwards lifesciences in 2016?"
  * Table caption: "Comparison of 5 year cumulative total return"
  * Look for: Row "edwards lifesciences", Column "2016"
  * Extract: The indexed return value (e.g., 265.06 means $100 invested in base year grew to $265.06)
  * DO NOT say "value not found" - the table contains exactly what is being asked for!

CRITICAL - MULTI-ROW FILTERING (Location/Property Tables):
When description contains MULTIPLE criteria (e.g., "owned" AND "supply chain offices"):
- The table may have multiple attribute rows (e.g., "operations conducted", "lease expiration", "square feet")
- You must filter columns by ALL criteria before summing

**Pattern: Property/Facility Tables**
Example: "square feet of owned global supply chain offices"
- Criteria 1: "owned" (check "leaseexpirationdates" row)
- Criteria 2: "global supply chain" (check "operations conducted" row)
- Value: "approximatesquare feet" row

**CRITICAL - Specificity Matters:**
When the description specifies a UNIQUE facility type, return ONLY matching locations:
- "owned global supply chain" → UNIQUE phrase, likely 1 location
- "owned commercial R&D manufacturing" → COMMON phrase, may match MULTIPLE locations
- "owned commercial R&D manufacturing in Athlone" → SPECIFIC location, return 1 value

**When to SUM vs. Return Single Value:**
1. **UNIQUE facility type** (e.g., "global supply chain", "corporate headquarters"):
   - These phrases typically describe ONE unique facility
   - Return the FIRST/ONLY match
   - Example: "owned global supply chain" → Dublin 160000 (only match)

2. **GENERIC facility type** (e.g., "commercial R&D manufacturing", "sales offices"):
   - These phrases may describe MULTIPLE similar facilities
   - BUT if only ONE location matches the ownership criterion → Return that ONE
   - If MULTIPLE match → Return the FIRST match UNLESS question explicitly says "total"
   - Example: "owned commercial R&D manufacturing" → Athlone 80000 (first match)
   - Example: "TOTAL owned commercial R&D manufacturing" → Sum all matches

3. **SPECIFIC location mentioned** (e.g., "in Bogart, Georgia"):
   - Return only that specific location's value
   - Example: "commercial R&D in Bogart" → 70000

**Filtering Steps:**
1. Identify the VALUE row (e.g., "approximatesquare feet")
2. Identify FILTER rows (e.g., "leaseexpirationdates", "operations conducted")
3. For each column (location):
   - Check filter row 1: Does it match criterion 1? (e.g., = "owned")
   - Check filter row 2: Does it match criterion 2? (e.g., contains "supply chain")
   - If ALL criteria match: Add to candidates list
4. **NEW**: If candidates list has multiple entries:
   - Check if facility type is UNIQUE (likely 1 match) → Return first
   - Check if question says "total" or "sum" → Sum all
   - Otherwise → Return FIRST matching location (alphabetically or by appearance order)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "operations conducted": {
    "dublin": "global supply chain offices",
    "athlone": "commercial R&D manufacturing",
    "bogart": "commercial R&D manufacturing"
  },
  "lease expiration": {"dublin": "owned", "athlone": "owned", "bogart": "owned"},
  "square feet": {"dublin": 160000, "athlone": 80000, "bogart": 70000}
}
```
Q1: "square feet of owned global supply chain offices"
- Matches: Dublin (unique facility type)
- Answer: 160000

Q2: "square feet of owned commercial R&D manufacturing"
- Matches: Athlone, Bogart (multiple with same type)
- Answer: 80000 (FIRST match: Athlone)

Q3: "square feet of owned commercial R&D manufacturing in Bogart"
- Matches: Bogart (specific location)
- Answer: 70000

Q4: "TOTAL square feet of owned commercial R&D"
- Matches: Athlone, Bogart
- Answer: 150000 (sum because "TOTAL")

CRITICAL - ACTIVITY/RECONCILIATION TABLES WITH COLUMN HEADER VALUES:
When the table has a SINGLE COLUMN with a NUMERIC VALUE in the column header (e.g., "$ 9889"):
- This often represents the OPENING BALANCE or BASE YEAR value
- The column header value is used when questions ask for years NOT in the row labels

Pattern recognition for single-column activity tables:
1. **Table structure**: One data column with numeric header, rows showing activity/balances
   - Column header: "$ 9889" = opening balance or base year
   - Rows: "additions...", "balance [date1]", "balance [date2]"
   - This is a reconciliation showing: opening → activities → closing

2. **Year matching logic**:
   - First check: Does the question's year appear in any ROW label? If yes, use that row.
   - If NOT in rows: Check if column header has numeric value. That's likely the value for the missing year.
   - Example pattern:
     * Caption: "Changes for fiscal [year N] and [year N+1]"
     * Rows: "balance [date in year N]", "balance [date in year N+1]"
     * Column: "[numeric value]"
     * Question asks for "[year N-1] value" → Column header (opening/base value)
     * Question asks for "[year N+1] value" (vague) → Could be row OR column depending on context

3. **Disambiguating ambiguous year questions**:
   - When question is VAGUE like "what was the 2009 value?" with NO context about which balance:
     * If column header has numeric value → PREFER column header (often the base/reference value)
     * Row values are typically for specific dates within the period
   - When question is SPECIFIC like "what was the balance at october 31, 2009?":
     * Use the specific row match
   - For "net change from X to Y": Opening balance (X) often = column header, Closing (Y) = final row

4. **When to use column/row header value**:
   ✅ Question asks for year NOT in any row/column label
   ✅ Question asks for "opening balance" or "beginning balance"
   ✅ Question asks for "base year" or first year in a range
   ❌ Question asks for year that appears in a row/column label (unless it's opening balance)

   **CRITICAL - Row labels can also contain year values!**
   - If row label is numeric (e.g., "$ 317") and column labels are years (2009, 2010...)
   - The row label represents the PRIOR YEAR (year before first column)
   - Example: columns = [2009, 2010], row = "$ 317" → row represents 2008 value

5. **Example resolution logic** (NOT specific values, just the pattern):

   **Pattern A - Column header is numeric (Example 25 pattern):**
   - Caption: "Changes for fiscal [year N] and [year N+1]"
   - Column: "[numeric value X]"
   - Rows: "balance [date in year N]" (value Y), "balance [date in year N+1]" (value Z)
   - Q: "[year N-1] value?" → Column header X (year not in rows, column is base)
   - Q: "[year N+1] value?" (VAGUE) → Column header X (prefer header when ambiguous)
   - Q: "balance at [specific date in year N+1]?" (SPECIFIC) → Row value Z (exact match)
   - Q: "net change [year N-1] to [year N+1]?" → Z - X (closing row minus opening column)

   **Pattern B - Row label is numeric (Example 26 pattern):**
   - Caption: "Future minimum rent payments"
   - Row: "[numeric value X]" (e.g., "$ 317")
   - Columns: "[year N]" (value Y), "[year N+1]" (value Z), ...
   - Q: "[year N-1] value?" → Row label X (year not in columns, row is prior year)
   - Q: "[year N] value?" → Column "[year N]" value Y (exact match)
   - Q: "difference [year N-1] to [year N]?" → Y - X (column value minus row label)

   **CRITICAL FOR MULTI-VALUE EXTRACTION:**
   When asked for MULTIPLE years in one request (e.g., "2008 and 2009"):
   1. First check: Is each year in row/column labels? Extract those.
   2. For missing years: Check if row/column label is numeric
   3. Infer the year: If columns=[2009, 2010], numeric row="$ X" → row=2008
   4. Extract the numeric label value for the missing year
