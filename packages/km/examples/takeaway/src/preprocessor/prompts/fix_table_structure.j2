You are analyzing a financial table that has structural issues. The table has a SINGLE ROW where the row key appears to be a DATA VALUE rather than a category label.

MALFORMED TABLE:
{{ table_json }}

DOCUMENT CONTEXT:
{% if pre_text %}
Text before table:
{{ pre_text }}
{% endif %}

{% if post_text %}
Text after table:
{{ post_text }}
{% endif %}

TASK:
The row key "{{ row_key }}" appears to be a data value (likely a currency amount or number) that should actually be IN the table as a data point, not used as a row label.

Based on the document context and the column names in the table, determine:
1. What does this numeric row key represent? (e.g., "opening balance", "total amount", "balance at january 1 2010")
2. What should the proper row label be? (e.g., "valuation allowance", "total", "summary")

Then restructure the table with:
- A meaningful row label (category name)
- The numeric row key value added as a new column with appropriate label

Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "fixed_table": {
    "<proper_row_label>": {
      "<new_column_name>": <numeric_value_from_row_key>,
      "<existing_column_1>": <existing_value_1>,
      "<existing_column_2>": <existing_value_2>,
      ...
    }
  },
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation of what the row key represents and why you chose this structure>"
}

IMPORTANT:
- The new column should be placed FIRST (leftmost) since it's likely the opening/initial value
- Choose descriptive names based on the document context
- Preserve all existing columns and values exactly
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
