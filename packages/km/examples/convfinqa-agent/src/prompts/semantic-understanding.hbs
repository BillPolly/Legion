You are analyzing a financial question to understand what is being asked semantically.

Question: "{{question}}"

{{#if relevantConcepts}}
Relevant Ontology Concepts (from semantic search):
{{#each relevantConcepts}}
  - {{this.label}} ({{this.classURI}}) - {{this.similarity}}% match
{{/each}}
{{else}}
Relevant Ontology Concepts: (none available)
{{/if}}

{{#if sampleLabels}}
Available Entity Labels (from knowledge graph):
{{#each sampleLabels}}
  - "{{this}}"
{{/each}}
{{else}}
Available Entity Labels: (none available)
{{/if}}

{{#if years}}
Available Years: {{years}}
{{else}}
Available Years: (none)
{{/if}}

{{#if categories}}
Available Categories: {{categories}}

{{#if tableMetadata}}
{{#if tableMetadata.containsPercentages}}
Table Format:
  - Contains percentages: YES
  - Percentage precision: {{tableMetadata.percentagePrecision}} decimal place(s)
  - Examples: {{tableMetadata.percentageExamples}}
{{/if}}
{{#if tableMetadata.scalingFactor}}
  - Scaling factor: {{tableMetadata.scalingFactor}}
{{/if}}
{{/if}}

Your task: Provide a SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING of this question in terms of:

1. **Ontology Concepts**: What type of entities is this about?
   - Reference the concepts above if available
   - Focus on high similarity matches

2. **Named Entities**: Which specific entities are mentioned?
   - Use exact entity names from available labels
   - Be precise with entity identification

3. **Relations**: What relationship or operation is being asked?
   - Examples: "compare", "calculate percentage change", "find difference", "sum"
   - Be specific (e.g., "cumulative_return over time")

4. **Temporal/Categorical Scope**: What time period or category?
   - For cumulative/indexed metrics: identify the END year of the period
   - Example: "5-year period ending 2009" → Use year 2009
   - For ranges: identify both start and end years

5. **Output Format**: How should the answer be formatted?
   - Unit: percentage (%), dollars ($), millions, billions, raw number
   - Precision: number of decimal places (default 1 for percentages, 2 for proportions)
   - Format conventions: Must include % for percentages, $ for monetary amounts

Examples of output format analysis:
- "what was the percentage increase" → Unit: %, Precision: 1, Format: Must include %
- "what portion of total" → Unit: %, Precision: 2, Format: Must include %
- "total in millions" → Unit: millions, Precision: 1

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on WHAT is being asked, not HOW to query it
- Use ontology terminology and named entities from the available lists
- Describe semantic meaning, not query mechanics
- Explicitly state output format requirements
