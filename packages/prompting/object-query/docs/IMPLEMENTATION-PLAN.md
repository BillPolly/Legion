# Object-Query Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the refactor step - we aim to get it right the first time. The implementation will be guided by the comprehensive [Design Document](./DESIGN.md) and focuses solely on functional correctness for MVP delivery.

## Implementation Approach

### Core Principles
- **TDD Methodology**: Write tests first, then implement to pass tests
- **No Refactor Step**: Design carefully upfront, implement correctly first time
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit tests and integration tests for full coverage
- **Real Dependencies**: Use actual object traversal, real data transformations
- **Fail Fast**: No fallbacks, raise errors immediately when something goes wrong
- **No Mocks in Implementation**: Implementation code never contains mock implementations

### Testing Rules
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods in isolation (mocks allowed)
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows with real dependencies (NO MOCKS)
- **Real Processing**: Use actual path traversal, real transformations, real object processing
- **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive testing of error cases and edge conditions

### Scope for MVP
- **Functional Correctness**: Core functionality working as specified
- **Local Development**: Running in development environment only
- **UAT Ready**: Suitable for user acceptance testing
- **No NFRs**: No security, performance, scalability, or deployment concerns
