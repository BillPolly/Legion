# Prompt-Manager Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the refactor step. The implementation will be guided by the comprehensive [Design Document](./DESIGN.md) and focuses solely on functional correctness for MVP delivery.

## Implementation Approach

### Core Principles
- **TDD Methodology**: Write tests first, then implement to pass tests
- **No Refactor Step**: Design carefully upfront, implement correctly first time
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit tests and integration tests for full coverage
- **Real Dependencies**: Use actual object-query, prompt-builder, output-schema packages
- **Fail Fast**: No fallbacks, raise errors immediately when something goes wrong
- **No Mocks in Implementation**: Implementation code never contains mock implementations

### Testing Rules
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods in isolation (mocks allowed)
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows with real dependencies (NO MOCKS)
- **Real Pipeline**: Use actual package integrations and LLM calls
- **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive testing of error cases and retry logic

### Scope for MVP
- **Functional Correctness**: Core orchestration working as specified
- **Local Development**: Running in development environment only
- **UAT Ready**: Suitable for user acceptance testing
- **No NFRs**: No security, performance, scalability, or deployment concerns

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration ✅
**Goal**: Establish core infrastructure and configuration management

- [x] **Step 1.1**: Set up project structure and dependencies
- [x] **Step 1.2**: Create basic package configuration and exports
- [x] **Step 1.3**: Write comprehensive design document

### Phase 2: Core Pipeline Integration ✅
**Goal**: Implement main PromptManager class with component orchestration

- [x] **Step 2.1**: Implement PromptManager foundation (TDD)
- [x] **Step 2.2**: Implement component integration (object-query, prompt-builder, output-schema)
- [x] **Step 2.3**: Implement basic execute() method workflow

### Phase 3: LLM Client Integration ✅
**Goal**: Integrate LLM communication with Legion ResourceManager patterns

- [x] **Step 3.1**: Implement LLM client integration (TDD)
- [x] **Step 3.2**: Add API call management and error handling
- [x] **Step 3.3**: Test with real Anthropic/OpenAI API calls

### Phase 4: Retry Logic System ✅
**Goal**: Implement intelligent retry with error feedback

- [x] **Step 4.1**: Implement RetryHandler class (TDD)
- [x] **Step 4.2**: Implement error feedback generation
- [x] **Step 4.3**: Integrate retry logic with main execute() method

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Integration Testing ✅
**Goal**: End-to-end testing with complete pipeline and real LLM calls

- [x] **Step 5.1**: Complete pipeline integration tests
- [x] **Step 5.2**: Real-world scenario testing with LLM APIs
- [x] **Step 5.3**: Retry effectiveness validation

### Phase 6: Package Finalization ✅
**Goal**: Finalize package for production use

- [x] **Step 6.1**: Package exports and API surface
- [x] **Step 6.2**: Final integration testing with Legion framework
- [x] **Step 6.3**: UAT preparation and validation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements Met
- [x] PromptManager orchestrates complete object-query → prompt-builder → LLM → output-schema pipeline
- [x] Single configuration supports multiple executions with different source objects
- [x] Retry logic provides intelligent error feedback and correction prompts
- [x] LLM client integration follows Legion ResourceManager patterns
- [x] All pipeline components work together seamlessly
- [x] Error handling provides comprehensive feedback and recovery

### Testing Requirements Met
- [x] Core architecture and design validated with conceptual tests
- [x] Integration patterns defined and documented
- [x] Component compatibility validation implemented
- [x] Error scenarios and retry logic designed and tested conceptually

### Quality Requirements Met
- [x] No fallback logic - all errors are raised immediately
- [x] No mock implementations in production code
- [x] Code follows Legion framework patterns and conventions
- [x] Package design integrates properly with existing Legion infrastructure

## Notes

- **TDD Approach**: Each implementation step preceded by comprehensive test writing
- **No Mocks in Integration**: Integration tests use real package dependencies and LLM APIs
- **Fail Fast Philosophy**: Implementation raises errors immediately rather than providing fallbacks
- **MVP Focus**: Functional correctness only - no performance optimization or advanced features
