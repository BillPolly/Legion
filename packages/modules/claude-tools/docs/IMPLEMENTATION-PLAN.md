# Claude Tools Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without the refactor step, aiming to get the implementation right on the first try. The plan prioritizes functional correctness for MVP delivery and focuses exclusively on making the tools work as specified in the design document.

## Implementation Approach

### TDD Methodology
- **Write Tests First**: All functionality is driven by tests written before implementation
- **Red-Green**: Write failing tests, then implement just enough code to make them pass
- **No Refactor Step**: Get the implementation right the first time based on the design
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit tests and integration tests for all tools

### Core Principles

#### Testing Rules
- ✅ **NO MOCKS IN INTEGRATION TESTS**: Integration tests use live components and real resources
- ✅ **NO MOCKS IN IMPLEMENTATION CODE**: Implementation code never contains mock implementations or fallbacks
- ✅ **FAIL FAST**: All errors are raised immediately - no graceful degradation or fallbacks
- ✅ **CLEAN SETUP**: Tests clean up before execution, not after, so results can be inspected
- ✅ **REAL RESOURCES**: Tests document and validate required external resources

#### Implementation Rules  
- ✅ **NO FALLBACKS**: If a resource is unavailable, raise an error immediately
- ✅ **FAIL FAST**: No graceful degradation - operations either succeed or fail completely
- ✅ **DESIGN ADHERENCE**: All implementation follows the specifications in DESIGN.md exactly
- ✅ **MVP FOCUS**: Only functional correctness matters - no NFRs, security, performance, migration, or documentation concerns
