# ShowMe Handle Integration - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan details the implementation of Handle integration for ShowMe module, enabling display of Legion Handles in chromeless browser windows with rich introspection and interaction capabilities.

**Reference Document**: All implementation details are specified in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md). This plan provides the execution sequence only.

## Implementation Approach

### Core Principles
1. **TDD Without Refactor**: Write tests first, implement correctly the first time
2. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Use real ResourceManager, real Handles, real services
3. **No Mocks in Implementation Code**: Only real services and resources, fail fast on errors
4. **Fail-Fast**: Every error raises an exception with clear context
5. **Phase-Based**: Each phase delivers working, demonstrable functionality
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for flows

### Testing Rules
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes/functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete flows with real dependencies (NO MOCKS)
- **All Tests Must Pass**: No skipping, no fallbacks, tests fail if resources unavailable
- **Test Location**: All tests in `__tests__/` directory
- **Run Tests Sequentially**: Use `--runInBand` for Jest

### Workflow Rules
1. **Read Design**: At the beginning of each phase, reread [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)
2. **Write Tests First**: Unit tests, then integration tests, then implementation
3. **Run Tests Continuously**: After each implementation step
4. **Update Plan**: Mark completed steps with ✅
5. **Commit Per Phase**: Commit and push after each completed phase

## Progress Summary

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Handle Detection and Resolution (62 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 2: HandleRenderer Implementation (50 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 3: StrategyRenderer Implementation (36 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 4: ShowAssetTool Handle Integration (49 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 5: Actor Protocol Updates (21 tests passing)
- ✅ Phase 6: App Mode Browser Launch (implementation complete)
- ✅ Phase 7: End-to-End Integration Testing (18 tests passing)
- **Total: 236 tests passing, ALL 7 phases complete**

**ALL PHASES COMPLETE! 🎉**

**Summary:**
All core Handle integration functionality is complete and validated. The system can detect, resolve, and display Legion Handles via ShowAssetTool with Actor protocol support and chromeless browser launch.

**Note**: Phase 7 is comprehensive E2E testing. All core functionality is complete and working. This phase validates the entire system end-to-end.

**Note**: Phases 1-4 provide complete core Handle functionality. Phases 5-6 are required for Actor-based display in production. Phase 7 is optional E2E testing. See [PHASE-1-4-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md](./PHASE-1-4-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md) for details.
