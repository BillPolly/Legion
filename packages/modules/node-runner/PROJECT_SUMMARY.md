# Node Runner Project Summary

## Project Completion Status: ✅ MVP COMPLETE

### Overview
The Legion Node Runner package has been successfully developed following strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The project provides a comprehensive Node.js process management and logging framework designed for AI agents within the Legion framework.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Architecture & Design
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with managers, tools, storage, and search components
- **Event-Driven Design**: Full EventEmitter integration for real-time progress tracking
- **Dependency Injection**: ResourceManager pattern for flexible configuration
- **Tool-Based Interface**: 5 MCP tools providing comprehensive functionality

### 2. Core Features Implemented
- **Process Management**: Full lifecycle control with spawn, monitor, and termination
- **Session Management**: Track execution sessions with statistics and metadata
- **Log Storage**: Structured log storage with filtering and time-based queries
- **Search Engine**: 4 search modes (keyword, semantic, regex, hybrid) with caching
- **Server Management**: Web server lifecycle with health monitoring
- **Frontend Integration**: WebSocket server and JavaScript injection for browser logs

### 3. MCP Tools Suite
1. **RunNodeTool**: Execute Node.js processes with comprehensive options
2. **StopNodeTool**: Terminate processes (individual/session/all modes)
3. **SearchLogsTool**: Multi-mode log search with pagination
4. **ListSessionsTool**: Query and manage execution sessions
5. **ServerHealthTool**: System health and resource monitoring

### 4. Testing Coverage
- **Total Tests**: 364+ tests across 16 test suites
- **Unit Tests**: 14 suites covering all components
- **Integration Tests**: 2 suites for end-to-end validation
- **Mock Provider**: Custom in-memory storage for testing
- **Test Approach**: TDD with tests written before implementation

### 5. Documentation
- **README.md**: 722 lines of comprehensive documentation
- **API Reference**: Complete documentation for all tools and components
- **Examples**: 2 full example applications (Express.js and React)
- **Release Notes**: Version 1.0.0 with complete feature list
- **Development Plan**: Detailed TDD implementation tracking

### 6. Example Applications
- **Express.js Example**: Demonstrates backend process management
- **React Example**: Shows frontend log capture capabilities
- **Test Script**: Automated validation of both examples
