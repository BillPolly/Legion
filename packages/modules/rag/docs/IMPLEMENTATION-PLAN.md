# Semantic Search RAG Module - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology without the refactor step - we aim to get it right the first time. The implementation will be done in phases, with comprehensive testing at each step to ensure functional correctness.

## Implementation Rules

### Testing Principles
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, then implement to make tests pass
- **No Refactor Phase**: Design carefully upfront, implement correctly first time
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both unit tests and integration tests required
- **NO MOCKS in Integration Tests**: All integration tests use real dependencies (MongoDB, Qdrant, Nomic, LLM)
- **NO MOCKS in Implementation Code**: Implementation code never uses mocks or fallbacks
- **Mocks Only in Unit Tests**: Unit tests may use mocks for isolated testing

### Error Handling Principles  
- **NO FALLBACKS**: Always raise errors when operations fail
- **FAIL FAST**: Detect and report errors immediately
- **NO SILENT FAILURES**: Every error must be reported and handled
- **Detailed Error Context**: Provide comprehensive error information for debugging

### Code Quality Rules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/method has one clear purpose
- **Clean Architecture**: Follow Uncle Bob's principles
- **Legion Conventions**: Follow established module and tool patterns
- **ResourceManager Only**: All configuration through ResourceManager singleton

- **Integration Success**: Seamless operation with existing Legion infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all anticipated error conditions

## Completion Tracking

Each checkbox will be updated with âœ… when the corresponding step is completed and all tests pass.

**Phase Completion Rules**:
- All steps in a phase must be completed before moving to next phase
- All tests (unit + integration) must pass for each step
- No step is considered complete until comprehensive testing is done
- Integration tests must use real dependencies (MongoDB, Qdrant, Nomic, LLM)

**Final Acceptance Criteria**:
