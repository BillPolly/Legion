# Conan-the-Deployer Development Plan

## Overview

This development plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles without the refactor step. Each phase includes writing tests first, then implementing functionality to make those tests pass.

## Development Approach

## Success Criteria

Each phase is considered complete when:
1. All tests are written and passing
2. Code coverage meets targets (>90%)
3. Documentation is updated
4. Integration tests pass
5. No known critical issues

## Timeline Estimates

- Phase 1: 2 days (Foundation)
- Phase 2: 3 days (Local Provider)
- Phase 3: 2 days (Deployment Manager)
- Phase 4: 3 days (Monitoring System)
- Phase 5: 4 days (Docker Provider)
- Phase 6: 4 days (Railway Provider)
- Phase 7: 3 days (Tools)
- Phase 8: 2 days (Integration Testing)
- Phase 9: 2 days (Documentation)
- Phase 10: 1 day (Polish and Release)

**Total Estimated Time**: 26 days

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Docker Availability**: Graceful degradation if Docker not available
2. **Railway API Changes**: Version lock GraphQL schema
3. **Resource Constraints**: Implement resource limits
4. **Network Issues**: Implement retry mechanisms
5. **Security Concerns**: Regular security audits

## Notes

- Each checkbox should be marked when the step is complete
- Tests must be written before implementation
- Commit after each completed section
- Regular progress reviews recommended
- Flexibility to adjust plan based on discoveries
