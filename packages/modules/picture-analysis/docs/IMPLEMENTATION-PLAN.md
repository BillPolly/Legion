# Picture Analysis Tool Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to build the Picture Analysis Tool as specified in the DESIGN.md document. The implementation will be done in phases, with comprehensive unit and integration testing throughout.

## Approach and Rules

### TDD Approach
- **Write tests first** before implementing functionality
- **Write minimal code** to make tests pass
- **No refactor step** - aim to get implementation right first time
- **Comprehensive test coverage** including unit tests and integration tests

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test full workflows with real dependencies
- **NO MOCKS in integration tests** - use real ResourceManager, real LLM client, real file system
- **NO MOCKS in implementation code** - no fallback mechanisms, errors should be raised
- **NO FALLBACKS** - if an operation fails, raise a clear error

### Implementation Rules
- Follow Legion framework patterns exactly as specified in DESIGN.md
- Use ResourceManager for all dependency injection
- Use @legion/llm client for all vision API calls
- Implement all validation and error handling as specified
- Follow the exact API specification for inputs and outputs
- Implement all file handling, path resolution, and format validation

### MVP Scope
- **Functional correctness only** - no NFRs (security, performance, migration, documentation)
- **Local running and UAT** - no publishing or deployment concerns
- **Core functionality**: file path + prompt â†’ vision analysis response

## Notes

- This plan focuses purely on functional correctness for MVP
- No consideration for security, performance, or other NFRs in this phase
- All testing uses real dependencies - no mocks in integration tests
- Implementation should raise errors rather than provide fallbacks
- All specifications from DESIGN.md must be implemented exactly as documented
