## Notes and Reminders

### Testing Best Practices
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean up resources after tests
- Use realistic test data

### Common Issues to Watch For
- Database connection leaks
- Event listener memory leaks
- Async operation timing issues
- File system cleanup in tests
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Update Instructions
To mark a test as complete:
1. Change ⬜ to ✅ in the progress tracker
2. Update the module count in the phase status
3. Add completion date to daily log
4. Note any issues or learnings
