Analyze this task and classify it as either SIMPLE or COMPLEX:

Task: "{{taskDescription}}"

Classification criteria:
- SIMPLE: Can be accomplished with a sequence of 1 or more direct tool calls
  Examples: "read a file", "parse JSON", "create a directory", "write code to a file"
  
- COMPLEX: Requires breaking down into subtasks or involves multiple coordinated operations
  Examples: "build a web application", "create a full API with authentication", "refactor a codebase"

Consider:
1. Does this task have a clear, direct solution using available tools?
2. Would this task benefit from being broken into smaller, more manageable pieces?
3. Is this a single operation or multiple related operations?
