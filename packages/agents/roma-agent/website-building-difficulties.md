# ROMA Agent Website Building Difficulties Log

## Purpose

This document records real-time difficulties encountered while trying to get the ROMA agent to build a website. The focus is on practical problems that arise during the actual website building process, such as:

- Lack of visibility into what the agent is thinking
- Not knowing what the generated UI looks like
- Missing feedback about the agent's decision-making process
- Difficulties in understanding the agent's progress
- Problems with validating the output quality
- Issues with the agent's understanding of the requirements

## Testing Context

**Goal**: Get ROMA agent to build a responsive portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
**Requirements**: Header with navigation, hero section, about section, projects section, contact form, modern CSS Grid/Flexbox layout

---

## Difficulties Encountered

### 1. **Execution Timeout Issues** (First Major Problem)
- **Issue**: The ROMA agent execution timed out after 2 minutes while building the website
- **Impact**: Cannot see the complete result or understand what the agent was doing during the long execution
- **Visibility Problem**: No progress indication during the 11+ second execution time
- **What I couldn't see**: 
  - Which subtasks the agent was working on
  - How it decomposed the website building task
  - Whether it was stuck or making progress
  - What tools it was using internally

### 2. **Lack of Real-Time Progress Feedback**
- **Issue**: No visibility into agent's thought process during execution
- **Missing Information**:
  - Task decomposition strategy used
  - Which execution strategy was selected (recursive, parallel, atomic)
  - Internal subtask creation and execution order
  - Tool invocations and their results
- **Impact**: Can't debug or optimize the website building process

### 3. **Incomplete Result Output** 
- **Issue**: The result was truncated in the output, showing only partial HTML
- **What's Missing**: 
  - Complete CSS file content
  - JavaScript file content  
  - Full HTML structure
- **Difficulty**: Can't validate if all requirements were met

### 4. **Very Long Execution Times** (Major Issue)
- **Issue**: ROMA agent took 67+ seconds to complete a simple website building task
- **Progress Monitoring Reveals**:
  - Agent stays in "running" status for entire duration
  - No intermediate progress or subtask completion feedback
  - Execution was actually successful but took much longer than expected
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with no indication of progress

### 5. **Lack of Granular Progress Tracking**
- **Issue**: Progress monitoring only shows "running" status
- **Missing Details**:
  - Which strategy was selected (we can see RecursiveExecutionStrategy was used)
  - How many subtasks were created (result shows taskCount: 8 but no breakdown)
  - What each subtask was doing
  - Which subtasks completed and which are still running
- **What We Can See**: Only high-level execution ID and duration

### 6. **No Visibility into Recursive Decomposition Process**
- **Issue**: Can't see how the website building task was broken down
- **Missing Information**:
  - What subtasks were created from the original task
  - The dependency relationships between subtasks
  - Which execution strategy was used for each subtask
  - How the RecursiveExecutionStrategy decided to decompose the task

### 7. **Result Structure Not User-Friendly**
- **Issue**: The result is an array of 8 items but format is unclear
- **Problems**:
  - Results appear to be individual LLM responses rather than actual files
  - No clear mapping between results and expected deliverables
  - Can't easily identify which result corresponds to HTML, CSS, or JS
  - Tool usage appears embedded in text rather than executed properly

### 8. **Critical Issue: Tools Not Actually Being Executed** (MAJOR PROBLEM)
- **Issue**: ROMA agent returns LLM-generated text that *describes* tool usage instead of actually executing tools
- **Root Cause Found**: RecursiveExecutionStrategy uses LLM decomposition which generates text about tool usage, but doesn't parse and execute the tool calls
- **Evidence from Debug Test**:
  - AtomicExecutionStrategy properly calls `this.toolRegistry.getTool(toolName)` and `tool.execute(params)`
  - RecursiveExecutionStrategy generates LLM responses containing tool usage descriptions like: `I'll help you create a simple HTML file with a basic structure using the file_writer tool.\n\n<tool_use name="file_writer" parameters={"content":`
  - Result contains text descriptions instead of actual tool execution results
  - No actual files are being created
- **Impact**: 
  - Agent appears to work but produces no actual deliverables
  - All website building "results" are just descriptions, not real files
  - Major gap between expected behavior (file creation) and actual behavior (text generation)
- **Solution Required**: RecursiveExecutionStrategy needs to parse LLM responses for tool usage syntax and execute the tools via ToolRegistry

### 9. **Always Uses RecursiveExecutionStrategy Even for Simple Tasks**
- **Issue**: Even when explicitly marking task as `atomic: true`, RecursiveExecutionStrategy is used
- **Evidence**: Simple task with `atomic: true` still shows `strategy: 'RecursiveExecutionStrategy'`
- **Impact**: 
  - Unnecessary complexity for simple tasks
  - Longer execution times due to decomposition overhead
  - Strategy selection logic may not be working correctly

### 10. **Architectural Mismatch: LLM Decomposition vs Tool Execution** (ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE) - PARTIALLY FIXED
- **Issue**: RecursiveExecutionStrategy uses LLM decomposition but doesn't bridge to actual tool execution
- **Analysis**: 
  - AtomicExecutionStrategy: Has proper tool execution with `await tool.execute(params)` 
  - RecursiveExecutionStrategy: Uses `executeDirectly()` which calls LLM but doesn't parse tool usage
  - Missing component: Tool usage parser that extracts `<tool_use>` tags and executes them
- **Code Evidence**:
  - `AtomicExecutionStrategy.executeTool()` at line 191 properly handles tool execution
  - `RecursiveExecutionStrategy.executeDirectly()` at line 1022 only calls LLM without tool parsing
- **Proof Test Results**:
  - Recursive task result contains: `"Contains tool_use syntax: true"` and `"üö® PROBLEM: Tool usage found in TEXT, not executed!"`
  - LLM generates text like: `I'll help you write content to a file using the file_write tool...`
  - Result: `"‚ùå NO FILES CREATED by recursive strategy despite mentioning file_write"`
- **Impact**: 
  - Complete disconnect between task decomposition and actual work execution
  - Website building tasks generate plans but don't execute them
  - Fundamental architectural gap in the recursive execution flow
- **FIX ATTEMPTED**: Added tool call parsing and execution to RecursiveExecutionStrategy.executeDirectly()
- **STATUS**: Live tests show RecursiveExecutionStrategy can create files BUT AtomicExecutionStrategy still failing with validation errors

### 11. **Tool Registry Access Issues** (NEW ISSUE)
- **Issue**: `romaAgent.strategyManager.toolRegistry` is undefined during tests
- **Evidence**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toolRegistry')`
- **Impact**: Cannot access tools for testing, breaks tool registry integration tests
- **Root Cause**: StrategyManager may not be exposing toolRegistry properly

### 12. **AtomicExecutionStrategy Validation Failures** (NEW ISSUE)
- **Issue**: AtomicExecutionStrategy failing with "Input validation failed: Required"
- **Evidence**: Test shows `expect(result.success).toBe(true)` but `Received: false`
- **Impact**: Even simple atomic tool execution is failing
- **Severity**: Critical - basic tool execution broken

### 13. **LLM JSON Parsing Issues** (NEW ISSUE)
- **Issue**: "Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position X"
- **Evidence**: `Failed to parse LLM decomposition response` warnings
- **Impact**: RecursiveExecutionStrategy falling back from LLM decomposition
- **Root Cause**: LLM returning malformed JSON with control characters
