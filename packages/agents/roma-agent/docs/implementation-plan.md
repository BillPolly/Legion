# Artifact Management Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements the artifact management system as specified in `artifact-management-design.md` using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology without the refactor phase. Each component will be implemented correctly on the first attempt.

## Approach & Rules

### Core Principles
1. **TDD Without Refactor**: Write tests first, then implement to pass tests correctly on first try
2. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: All integration tests use real components
3. **No Mocks in Implementation**: Implementation code NEVER contains mock implementations
4. **No Fallbacks**: Raise errors immediately - fail fast
5. **Reference Design Document**: Always refer to `artifact-management-design.md` for specifications
6. **Reread at Each Phase**: First step of each phase is to reread the design document

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each new method/component
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- All tests must pass before moving to next step
- Tests verify functional correctness only (no NFR tests)

### Implementation Rules
- Artifact records are immutable once created
- Only the `value` field is extracted for tool use
- File artifacts store paths, not contents
- Each output has a specific type
- Complete separation of conversation history and artifacts

## Phase 1: Core ExecutionContext Implementation

✅ **Step 1.1**: Reread `artifact-management-design.md`

✅ **Step 1.2**: Write unit tests for new ExecutionContext artifact methods
   - Test `addArtifact()` method ✅
   - Test `getArtifact()` method ✅
   - Test `getArtifactValue()` method ✅
   - Test `listArtifacts()` method ✅
   - Test immutability of artifact records ✅
   - Test conversation history management ✅
   - Created 26 comprehensive unit tests

✅ **Step 1.3**: Implement new ExecutionContext class
   - Remove `previousResults` array ✅
   - Add `artifacts` Map ✅
   - Add `conversationHistory` array ✅
   - Implement artifact management methods ✅
   - Ensure artifact records remain immutable ✅
   - Complete rewrite of ExecutionContext with artifact system

✅ **Step 1.4**: Run and pass all ExecutionContext unit tests
   - Fixed test for undefined value validation - correctly expects error for undefined value
   - All 26 ExecutionContext artifact unit tests now passing

## Phase 2: ExecutionStrategy Base Class Updates

✅ **Step 2.1**: Reread `artifact-management-design.md` (focus on parameter resolution & tool execution)

✅ **Step 2.2**: Write unit tests for ExecutionStrategy artifact methods
   - Test `resolveToolInputs()` with @artifact references ✅
   - Test `executeToolWithArtifacts()` tool execution ✅
   - Test `formatConversationHistory()` output format ✅
   - Test `formatArtifactsCatalog()` output format ✅
   - Test `buildPrompt()` two-section structure ✅
   - Test `extractArtifactReferences()` helper ✅
   - Created 27 comprehensive unit tests

✅ **Step 2.3**: Implement ExecutionStrategy artifact methods
   - Add parameter resolution for @artifact_name syntax ✅
   - Add tool execution with artifact storage ✅
   - Add prompt formatting methods ✅
   - Add helper methods ✅
   - Implemented all 6 artifact management methods per design document

✅ **Step 2.4**: Run and pass all ExecutionStrategy unit tests
   - Fixed test assertion for file path length (12 chars not 4)
   - Fixed test artifacts to have valid timestamps
   - All 27 ExecutionStrategy artifact unit tests now passing

## Phase 3: Strategy Implementation Updates

☐ **Step 3.1**: Reread `artifact-management-design.md` (focus on strategy-specific usage)

☐ **Step 3.2**: Write tests for RecursiveExecutionStrategy
   - Test decomposition with artifact flow
   - Test artifact references in subtasks
   - Test artifact inheritance in child contexts

☐ **Step 3.3**: Update RecursiveExecutionStrategy
   - Use artifacts instead of previousResults
   - Pass artifacts through decomposition
   - Format prompts with artifact catalog

☐ **Step 3.4**: Run and pass RecursiveExecutionStrategy tests

☐ **Step 3.5**: Write tests for AtomicExecutionStrategy
   - Test tool result storage as artifacts
   - Test output specification handling

☐ **Step 3.6**: Update AtomicExecutionStrategy
   - Store tool results as named artifacts
   - Handle output specifications from LLM

☐ **Step 3.7**: Run and pass AtomicExecutionStrategy tests

☐ **Step 3.8**: Write tests for ParallelExecutionStrategy
   - Test artifact isolation between parallel branches
   - Test artifact merging after parallel execution

☐ **Step 3.9**: Update ParallelExecutionStrategy
   - Manage artifact flow in parallel execution
   - Merge artifacts from parallel branches

☐ **Step 3.10**: Run and pass ParallelExecutionStrategy tests

☐ **Step 3.11**: Write tests for SequentialExecutionStrategy
   - Test artifact chaining between steps
   - Test artifact accumulation

☐ **Step 3.12**: Update SequentialExecutionStrategy
   - Chain artifacts between sequential steps
   - Accumulate artifacts through sequence

☐ **Step 3.13**: Run and pass SequentialExecutionStrategy tests

## Phase 4: Integration Testing

☐ **Step 4.1**: Reread `artifact-management-design.md` (focus on complete examples)

☐ **Step 4.2**: Write integration test for complete task execution
   - Test task with decomposition and artifacts
   - Test @artifact parameter resolution in real tools
   - Test artifact persistence through execution tree
   - NO MOCKS - use real LLM and real tools

☐ **Step 4.3**: Write integration test for artifact naming and retrieval
   - Test multiple artifacts with different types
   - Test artifact overwriting/updating
   - Test artifact references across subtasks

☐ **Step 4.4**: Write integration test for conversation history
   - Test conversation history separation from artifacts
   - Test history formatting for LLM prompts

☐ **Step 4.5**: Run and pass all integration tests

## Phase 5: Full System Validation

☐ **Step 5.1**: Reread `artifact-management-design.md` (complete review)

☐ **Step 5.2**: Run complete test suite
   - All unit tests pass
   - All integration tests pass
   - 100% functional test coverage

☐ **Step 5.3**: Manual UAT testing
   - Execute sample task: "Create a web server"
   - Verify artifacts are created and referenced correctly
   - Verify conversation history is maintained separately
   - Verify no previousResults references remain

☐ **Step 5.4**: Fix any issues found in UAT
   - Write test for any bug found
   - Fix implementation
   - Verify all tests still pass

## Completion Criteria

- All checkboxes marked with ✅
- 100% test pass rate
- No references to `previousResults` in codebase
- Artifact system fully functional
- Real LLM integration working with artifacts
- Real tool execution with artifact storage

## Notes

- This plan will be updated with ✅ as steps are completed
- Any issues or deviations will be documented in each step
- The design document is the source of truth for all implementation details
