# ProjectPlannerStrategy Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation plan for the ProjectPlannerStrategy as specified in PROJECT_PLANNER_DESIGN.md. The implementation follows a phased approach with comprehensive unit and integration testing at each step.

## Implementation Approach

### Core Principles
1. **TDD Without Refactor**: Write tests first, implement to pass, get it right the first time
2. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Use real services for integration testing
3. **No Fallbacks**: Fail fast with clear error messages
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build incrementally with working code at each step

### Technical Rules
- **ResourceManager**: All environment variables accessed through ResourceManager singleton
- **Error Handling**: No fallbacks, raise errors immediately
- **Testing**: Jest for all tests, no test skipping
- **Dependencies**: Use existing Legion packages, no duplication
- **Code Style**: Clean architecture and clean code principles
