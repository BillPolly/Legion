# Gemini-Compatible Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a TDD approach without the refactor step - we aim to get it right first try. The approach builds simpler functionality first, with comprehensive testing at each step before moving to more complex components. We prioritize working results early and enhance them incrementally rather than using a big bang approach.

## Implementation Rules

### Testing Strategy
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, implement to make tests pass, no refactor step
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows with real components
- **NO MOCKS in Integration Tests**: Integration tests use real LLM clients, real file systems, real tools
- **NO MOCKS in Implementation Code**: Implementation never contains fallback or mock implementations
- **Fail Fast**: Errors are raised immediately, no fallbacks or graceful degradation

### Development Approach
- **Incremental**: Build simplest functionality first, test completely, then enhance
- **Early Working Results**: Each phase should produce demonstrable working functionality
- **Reference Design Doc**: Implementation details are in DESIGN.md, this plan focuses on sequence and testing
- **MVP Focus**: Functional correctness only, no NFRs (security, performance, migration, documentation)
- **Local/UAT Only**: No publishing or deployment concerns

### Legion Framework Compliance
- All code must use Legion patterns and standards as defined in DESIGN.md
- ResourceManager singleton for all environment access
- Legion's schema package for all validation
- Legion's tool registry patterns
- ConfigurableAgent base class
