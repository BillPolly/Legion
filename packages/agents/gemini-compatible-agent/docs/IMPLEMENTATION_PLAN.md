# Project Management System Implementation Plan
## Gemini Agent SD Tools Integration

### Version: 1.0 MVP
### Date: September 10, 2025

---

## Implementation Approach

### TDD Methodology
- Test-Driven Development without refactor step - get it right first time
- Unit tests first, then implementation to pass tests
- Integration tests with real components - **NO MOCKS in integration tests**
- Live testing with actual SD tools and agents
- Comprehensive test coverage for all components

### Development Strategy
- Build simple functionality first, test fully before complexity
- Working results early, then enhance incrementally
- No big bang approach - continuous working state
- Each step must be fully functional before next step

### Quality Rules
- **NO MOCKS** in integration tests - use real components
- **NO MOCKS** in implementation code - fail fast instead
- **NO FALLBACKS** - raise errors when dependencies unavailable
- Unit tests may use mocks for isolated testing only
- Functional correctness focus - no NFRs (security, performance, migration, documentation)
- Local running and UAT only - no deployment concerns

### Test Strategy
- Unit tests for individual component logic
- Integration tests with live SD module components
- End-to-end tests with real Gemini agent and UI
- Live UAT with MCP monitor tools
- All tests must pass before proceeding to next step
