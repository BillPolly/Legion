# Legion Shared Handle System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows TDD methodology without the refactor step - getting the implementation right on the first try. The implementation is driven by comprehensive test coverage including unit tests for individual components and integration tests with NO MOCKS for real-world validation.

## Implementation Rules

### Testing Rules
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods in isolation - mocks ALLOWED for dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows with REAL components - NO MOCKS EVER
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation for each component
- **100% Pass Rate**: All tests must pass before moving to next phase

### Code Rules  
- **NO MOCKS in implementation code**: Implementation must use real dependencies or fail fast
- **NO FALLBACKS**: If a dependency is missing or fails, raise an error immediately
- **FAIL FAST**: All errors must be explicit and immediate, no silent failures
- **MVP Focus**: Implement only functional correctness, ignore NFRs
