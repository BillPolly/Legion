# Unified Proxy Architecture - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement the unified proxy architecture as defined in `unified-proxy-architecture.md` using Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach without refactoring phase. Get implementation right on first attempt through comprehensive testing.

## Implementation Approach

### Architectural Decision: DataStoreProxy Wrapper Pattern
**Decision**: Use a DataStoreProxy wrapper class instead of modifying DataStore directly
- **Rationale**: Maintains separation of concerns, preserves backward compatibility
- **Benefits**: DataStore remains focused on storage logic, proxy functionality isolated
- **Pattern**: DataStoreProxy wraps DataStore and intercepts queries to return proxy objects

### TDD Methodology
1. **Write Tests First**: All functionality driven by tests written before implementation
2. **No Refactor Phase**: Aim to get implementation correct on first attempt  
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both unit tests and integration tests for all components
4. **Fail Fast**: No fallbacks or graceful degradation - raise clear errors

### Core Rules
- **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Use real DataStore, EntityProxy, and DataScript instances
- **No Mocks in Implementation**: No mock objects or fallback implementations in production code
- **No Fallbacks**: If something fails, throw descriptive error - no silent failures
- **MVP Focus**: Functional correctness only - no NFR concerns (performance, security, migration)
- **Local/UAT Only**: No publishing, deployment, or production concerns

### Success Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved with new proxy-based API
- Complete test coverage for new proxy types (CollectionProxy, StreamProxy)  
- All property access returns appropriate proxy objects
- All query methods return appropriate proxy objects
- Reactive subscriptions work across all proxy types
- Zero breaking changes to core DataStore/EntityProxy contracts (except return types)
