# Handle Introspection System: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to implement the Handle Introspection System as specified in HANDLE-INTROSPECTION.md. We build from core mechanisms outward, ensuring each phase delivers demonstrable value with comprehensive test coverage.

## Implementation Approach

### Core Principles

1. **TDD Without Refactor**: Write correct code first time - no refactor phase
2. **Dependency Order**: Build foundation first, elaborate afterward
3. **Demonstrable Value**: Each phase produces working, testable functionality
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for system behavior
5. **No Mocks in Integration Tests**: Integration tests use real components only
6. **Fail Fast**: Raise errors immediately - no fallbacks or mock implementations
7. **Synchronous Only**: All Handle operations must be synchronous per design

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes (MetaHandle, SchemaHandle, etc.) in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows using real ResourceManager, real schemas, real prototypes
- **No Mocks**: Integration tests MUST use actual components - never mocks
- **MVP Scope**: Focus on functional correctness only - no NFRs (security, performance, migration, documentation)
- **Local Running**: Implementation for local development and UAT only

### Success Criteria

Each phase is complete when:
- All unit tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- Functionality can be demonstrated with real examples
- Design document requirements are met
